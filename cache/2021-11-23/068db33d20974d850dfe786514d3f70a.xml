		    <title>Lectotypification of Chamaecyparis hodginsii of the Cupressaceae</title>

					<p>PhytoKeys 185: 117-122</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.185.75796</p>
					<p>Authors: Zhi Yang, Yong Yang, Keith Rushforth</p>
					<p>Abstract: Recent phylogenetic studies have suggested that the monotypic Fokienia A.Henry &amp; H.H.Thomas is nested within Chamaecyparis Spach, which is in agreement with separate morphological studies. Here the authors confirm a previous taxonomic treatment that incorporated Fokienia hodginsii (Dunn) A.Henry &amp; H.H.Thomas into Chamaecyparis based on the monophyly requirement of taxonomy, i.e. Chamaecyparis hodginsii (Dunn) Rushforth. In addition, the type collection of the basionym Cupressus hodginsii Dunn was found to contain three sheets of specimens, one in K including a vegetative branch (K000088294) and a separate ovulate cone (K001090486), a second one in A (A00022477), and a third one in IBSC (IBSC0016081). All three specimens are marked with Hongkong Herbarium No. 3505, but only the two specimens in K and IBSC possess similar handwriting of “Cupressus hodginsii Dunn”. The two specimens should be considered as syntypes according to the Shenzhen Code. The specimen in K is better preserved but it is a mixture according to the collection label: cones from Foochow (Fuzhou) and foliage from Yenping (Nanping). We lectotypified the name Cupressus hodginsii with K000088294 because the specimen is well preserved and has enough characters for identification. Moreover, an ovulate cone (K001090486) is on the same sheet.</p>

		    <title>Studies in Austral Bryaceae (Bryopsida). III. A Preliminary Account with Keys to Rosulabryum J.R. Spence in Chile</title>
		    <link>https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/70407/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>PhytoKeys 185: 87-98</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.185.70407</p>
					<p>Authors: John R. Spence</p>
					<p>Abstract: A preliminary study of the genus Rosulabryum J.R. Spence in Chile is presented, with brief species descriptions, notes on ecology and distributions, and a taxonomic key. The following 12 species are confirmed with vouchered specimens; Rosulabryum andicola (Hook.) Ochyra, Rosulabryum billarderii (Schwägr.) J.R. Spence, Rosulabryum campylothecium (Taylor) J.R. Spence, Rosulabryum capillare (Hedw.) J.R. Spence, Rosulabryum coloratum (Müll. Hal.) J.R. Spence, Rosulabryum densifolium (Brid.) Ochyra, Rosulabryum longidens (Thér.) J.R. Spence, Rosulabryum macrophyllum (Cardot &amp; Broth.) Ochyra, Rosulabryum perlimbatum (Cardot) Ochyra, Rosulabryum puconense (Herzog &amp; Thér.) J.R. Spence, Rosulabryum rubens (Mitt.) J.R. Spence, and Rosulabryum torquescens (Bruch ex De Not.) J.R. Spence. Rosulabryum canariense (Brid.) Ochyra is tentatively excluded as the Chilean material can be referred to R. coloratum. Similarly, Rosulabryum viridescens (Welw. &amp; Duby) Ochyra is tentatively excluded since the Chilean plants do not match the African type, but instead appear to be atypical plants of R. campylothecium.</p>

		    <title>Leaf epidermal micromorphology in Aspidistra (Asparagaceae): diversity and taxonomic significance</title>
		    <link>https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/72259/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>PhytoKeys 185: 65-86</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.185.72259</p>
					<p>Authors: Nikolay A. Vislobokov, Long-Fei Fu, Yi-Gang Wei, Maxim S. Nuraliev</p>
					<p>Abstract: Micromorphological characters of leaf epidermis were investigated in 69 species of Aspidistra using scanning electron microscopy. Sculpture of epidermis varies from smooth to verrucose and rugose in the genus. The abaxial epidermis of some species bears papillae, whereas the adaxial surface uniformly lacks the papillae. Sculpture type of epidermis and density of papillae are generally found to be stable characters at a species level. The infraspecific variation of epidermis sculpture, where present, ranges from smooth to verrucose or from verrucose to rugose. Micromorphological characters of leaf epidermis are shown to have potential taxonomic significance in Aspidistra; in combination with the type of shoot structure, they allow to subdivide the species into 13 groups. The groups are largely incongruent with floral morphological traits. An identification key to the studied species of Aspidistra based on vegetative characters (gross leaf and shoot morphology and characters of leaf epidermis) is presented.</p>

					<p>Authors: Wan-Yi Zhao, Kai-Wen Jiang, Zai-Xiong Chen , Bin Tian, Qiang Fan</p>
					<p>Abstract: Lespedeza danxiaensis (Fabaceae), a new species from Danxiashan National Nature Reserve in Guangdong Province, is described and illustrated. The new species is morphologically similar to Lespedeza pilosa, but it can be easily distinguished by its thin leathery leaflets and long peduncles. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS confirmed that the new species belongs to Lespedeza subg. Macrolespedeza. The new species is the first known species of Lespedeza endemic to Danxia landform and is currently only known from Mount Danxia, Guangdong.</p>

					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.185.71193</p>
					<p>Authors: Piotr Kosiński, Tomasz Maliński, Marcin Nobis, Magdalena Rojek-Jelonek, Dominik Tomaszewski, Monika Dering, Jerzy Zieliński</p>
					<p>Abstract: Based on field research in south-central Poland, supplemented with a review of herbarium materials, we identified a stable bramble biotype with a range large enough (190 km distance between the outermost stands) to be described as a new regional agamic species, Rubus kaznowskii sp.nov. It belongs to the series Subthyrsoidei(sect. Corylifolii). Although R. kaznowskii has a unique combination of features, it can be potentially mistaken for R. gothicus. It differs from the latter species in many aspects, including: pruinose primocanes, denser indumentum of the abaxial leaf surface, and more curved prickles on the petiole. R. kaznowskii has mainly been observed on rusty soils, in habitats of mixed coniferous and mixed broadleaf forests, usually in sunny places, along forest margins and roads, in clearings and roadside thickets.</p>

					<p>Authors: Jiang-Ping Shu, Zi-Yue Liu, Zhi-Rong Gu, Li-Jun Chen, Hong-Jin Wei, Xi-Le Zhou, Yue-Hong Yan, Rui-Jiang Wang</p>
					<p>Abstract: Dryopteris wulingshanensis, a new species growing on limestone in the Wulingshan Mountains, Hunan, China, is described and illustrated. This species is most similar to D. jishouensis and D. gymnophylla on general morphological traits, such as the form of scales, rhizome and sori, but differs by the number of vascular bundles at the base of the petiole, length to width ratio of lamina, stalk length of basal pinnae, division of the lamina, apex form of the pinnule and habitat. Moreover, molecular phylogenetic analysis using the chloroplast rbcL gene suggested that D. wulingshanensis, as the sister group of D. jishouensis, is a monophyletic clade. According to its restricted geographic range, small populations and few individuals, D. wulingshanensis should be considered endangered, according to the IUCN Red List criteria.</p>

					<p>Authors: María Virginia Palchetti, Juan José Cantero, Vanezza Morales-Fierro, Gloria E. Barboza, Andrés Moreira-Muñoz</p>
					<p>Abstract: Very few Solanaceae species are able to grow in saline soils; one of them is Lycium humile. This species is endemic to the Altiplano-Puna region (Central Andes, South America) where there are multiple extreme environmental conditions such as hypersaline soils. Here we present an updated description and distribution of L. humile including its new record for Bolivia at the edges of “Salar de Uyuni”, the largest salt flat in the world; we discuss its ecological role in saline environments by analyzing soil salinity and cover-abundance values ​​of the studied sites. According to IUCN criteria, we recommend a category of Least Concern for L. humile, but the growing development of lithium mining in saline environments of the Altiplano-Puna region may potentially threaten exclusive communities.</p>

					<p>Authors: Zhao-Jie Wen, Yun-Fen Huang, Yan-Hua Hu, Khang Sinh Nguyen, Lei Wu</p>
					<p>Abstract: A new species of Rubiaceae, Spiradiclis detianensis is described from a limestone karst area of southwestern China. This new species is morphologically similar to S. cordata and S. spathulata. All of them have rosetted habit and long peduncles, but it differs from the former by the cuneate leaf bases (vs. basally cordate) and much longer corolla tubes (1.8–2.2 cm long vs. ca. 5 mm long), and from the latter mainly by its tubular-funnel shaped corolla (vs. slenderly salver shaped), 4.5–6.8 (vs. 1.5–2) mm in diam, inside throat and corolla densely puberulent (vs. glabrous except a ring of long hairs at the middle). It also resembles to S. tubiflora, but differs clearly by its subrosulate habit (vs. procumbent to creeping), longer leaf blades (7.0–10.5 cm vs. 0.5–2.5 cm) and longer corolla tubes (18–22 mm vs. 14–16 mm). At same time, color photos, illustrations, detailed descriptions and conservation status of the new species are provided.</p>

					<p>Authors: Yi-Fei Lu, Yue-Liang Xu, Wen-Yuan Xie, Hong-Wei Zhang, Zi-Hong Zheng, Xin Cai, Xiao-Feng Jin</p>
					<p>Abstract: As the supplement of the flora of Zhejiang, East China, two new species were described with illustrations. Cerastium huadingense Y.F.Lu, W.Y.Xie &amp; X.F.Jin (Caryophyllaceae) differs from C. qingliangfengicum in having sterile stems absent, leaves sessile, petals slightly longer than sepals, and stamens slightly shorter than sepals. Ixeridium dimorphifolium Y.L.Xu, Y.F.Lu &amp; X.Cai (Asteraceae) differs from I. beauverdianum in having plant stoloniferous, basal leaves dimorphic, involucre 8‒10 mm long, inner phyllaries 8, and florets 7‒10. Paraphlomis setulosa C.Y.Wu &amp; H.W.Li (Lamiaceae) was reviewed and morphological characters of the corolla and stamens of its type and the specimens collected in the field survey were critically examined. With barbate anthers and strongly divergent anther cells, Paraphlomis setulosa was transferred to Sinopogonanthera, and S. setulosa (C.Y.Wu &amp; H.W.Li) H.W.Zhang &amp; X.F.Jin was consequently combined.</p>

					<p>Authors: Grzegorz J. Wolski, Paulina Nowicka-Krawczyk, William R. Buck</p>
					<p>Abstract: Plagiothecium schofieldii sp. nov. is described from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, U.S.A. Some morphological features of this species correspond to P. lamprostachys (Southern Hemisphere species); however, Plagiothecium schofieldii is genetically and morphologically different from this and other common Northern Hemisphere species e.g., P. denticulatum, P. platyphyllum, or P. ruthei. The most important distinguishing morphological features differentiating this species are: the arrangement of the leaves on the stem; dimensions, concavity and symmetry of the leaves; dimensions of cells and their areolation; orientation of capsules. Additionally, due to the strong concavity of the leaves, they are very often badly damaged under the microscope. We present the results of DNA research of the analyzed samples, and a detailed description of the morphological features. The new species is illustrated, and its ecological preferences and currently known geographical distribution are presented. Additionally, the authors propose to add this species to Plagiothecium section, which is confirmed by morphological features and genetic analysis.</p>

		    <title>Genetic diversity of Salix lapponum populations in Central Europe</title>
		    <link>https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/71641/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>PhytoKeys 184: 83-101</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.184.71641</p>
					<p>Authors: Jacek Urbaniak, Paweł Kwiatkowski, Paweł Pawlikowski</p>
					<p>Abstract: Salix lapponum is a cold-tolerant relict species in Europe that occurs in several sites, probably reflecting previous migration routes of S. lapponum during the Pleistocene. However, only a few data are available on the genetic structures of populations of S. lapponum. In this study, we use PCR-ISSR markers to investigate genetic variation in 19 European populations of S. lapponum L. AMOVA analysis shows that most of the variation (55.8%) occurs within populations; variability among groups accounts for 19.7%. An AMOVA analysis based on four groups determined by STRUCTURE analysis shows similar results: variability of 54.1% within the population and variability of 18.9% between the four population groups, based on geographic regions. Within individual geographic groups, which are characterised by the studied populations, the lowest variability (as well as the highest homogeneity) was found in populations located in Belarus. The obtained results are consistent with our expectations that the European Lowland could be a significant geographic barrier for gene flow over large geographic distances for S. lapponum. Both the Scandinavian and Belarusian populations, as well as those coming from NE Poland, are characterised by significant genetic distinctiveness. However, some populations from NE Poland and the Sudetes show similarities with populations from other geographic regions, indicating existing genetic relationships between them. Moreover, the results suggest a fairly clear division of the population into 4 emerging geographic regions, although separated by a geographical barrier: the Polish lowland, which forms part of the larger geographic unit known as the European Lowland.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Diospyros dussaudii is a poorly known species and previous descriptions lacked details about its female flowers and fruits. The species had not been recorded since type collections were made in 1913. As a result of our Diospyros research in Thailand, new specimens and data are now available for this species. In this study, we provide an updated morphological description, illustrations, lectotypification and a distribution map. The species was previously reported to be endemic to Laos; as such, the occurrences in Thailand greatly expand the distribution of the species. In addition, we analysed the phylogenetic relationships between D. dussaudii and other Diospyros species from Southeast Asia and other regions, using DNA sequence data from eight plastid regions. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that D. dussaudii is closely related to D. castanea, D. dasyphylla and D. insidiosa. Their taxonomic affinities are discussed.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Cuscuta mantiqueirana Costea, S.S. Silva &amp; Sim.-Bianch. a new species from montane cloud forests of the Serra da Mantiqueira, Brazil, is described and illustrated. The morphological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the new species belongs to sect. Subulatae of subg. Grammica. The new species is related to C. odorata var. botryoides, C. rotundiflora and C. globiflora from which it differs in narrower calyx lobes and the presence of four stomatiferous lobes or projections at the distal part of the ovary. A detailed morphological comparison with C. odorata var. botryoides, morphologically the most similar taxon, is provided along with the geographical distribution, ecology and host range of the species. The morphological and phylogenetic relationships of the new species, as well as the diversity of stomatiferous projections, are discussed in the broader context of sect. Subulatae and subg. Grammica. Cuscuta boliviana var. paranensis is considered a synonym of C. odorata var. botryoides.</p>

					<p>Abstract: In this study, samples were collected from the Java Sea coasts, from the South China Sea in Hainan Island coasts and Quảng Yên region and Rú Chá mangrove near Hue in Central Vietnam. In studied samples a total of eight Luticola species have been observed. Three of the taxa studied are described herein as species new to science – Luticola orientalis sp. nov., L. cribriareolata sp. nov. and L. halongiana sp. nov. Under light microscopy (LM) L. orientalis sp. nov. and L. cribriareolata sp. nov. are similar with rhombic-lanceolate to rhombic/ elliptic-lanceolate to elliptic valve shapes and narrowly rounded apices. Both species can be easily distinguished by stria density (higher density in L. orientalis). Under SEM L. cribriareolata is characterized by cribrate areola occlusions, a character thus far observed only in three established species. The remaining species of the whole genus known thus far are characterized by hymenate areola. Similar morphology Luticola species have been observed from tropical mangrove forests from Madagascar but they all can be easily distinguished based on the lack of grooves in the central area. The third species – L. halongiana sp. nov. has rhombic-elliptic to rhombic-lanceolate valves with broadly rounded to slightly protracted apices in larger specimens. This species has a relatively broad central area. Also unique among brackish-water Luticola is the small, rounded stigma positioned almost midway between the valve center and valve margin. In the habitats from which the new species are described we also identified five established Luticola taxa including, L. belawanensis, L. celebesica, L. inserata, L. seposita and L. tropica. For those species we provide detailed SEM characteristics of valve ultrastructure, as well as the range of environmental conditions and geographic distribution within the study area.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species, Allium negianum (Amaryllidaceae), belongs to the genus Allium subg. Rhizirideum, sect. Eduardia is described here from the Uttarakhand Himalayan region of India. This taxon grows in Malari region of Niti valley in Chamoli district and Dharma valley of Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand, India. It is a narrowly distributed species and morphologically more closer to A. przewalskianum Regel but differentiated by its tunic color of bulb, umbel with lax flowers, peduncle length, perigone colour, size and shape and leaf anatomy. Taxonomic delineation and relationship analysis based on nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS) region indicated that A. negianum is distinct and related to A. przewalskianum. This study provided a comprehensive description and comparison with A. przewalskianum, an identification key and notes on the distribution of the species.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Perrottetia taronensis from the Dulong Jiang valley in northwestern Yunnan Province, China and the Babulongtan mountain range in northern Kachin State, Myanmar is here described as a new species of the Dipentodontaceae. It is the third species of the genus to be recognized for China and the first to be reported for Myanmar. It is similar to P. alpestris s.s. but differs by characters of its leaf margins, inflorescences, and fruit. The three subspecies of P. alpestris recognized by Hou in “Flora Malesiana” are here recognized as three distinct species, i.e., P. alpestris, P. moluccana, and P. philippinensis on the basis of differences in diagnostic characters and distribution. The report in the “Flora of China” of the Taiwan species P. arisanensis from Yunnan is determined to be incorrect due to misidentification of two specimens at KUN.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Euphorbia mbuinzauensis, a succulent new species of the Synadenium group in Euphorbiaceae from Makueni County, Kenya, is described and illustrated. Morphologically, it is most similar to E. pseudomollis, but differs mainly by its shrubby habit (up to 4 m), abaxial leaves surfaces with densely stellate hairs, 2–4-forked cymes, smaller bracts (ca. 2.5 × 3.0 mm), smaller cyathia (6 mm wide), crimson glands without narrow smooth margin, smaller fruits (ca. 8 × 7 mm) and ovoid seeds (ca. 1.8 × 2.2 mm). Furthermore, we performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Synadenium group in Euphorbia sect. Monadenium, based on complete nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) datasets. This phylogenetic inference also supports it to be a distinct species. The new species is assessed as Endangered using the IUCN criteria.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species, Corybas papillatus, is described and illustrated from peninsular Thailand. The new species is easily recognized through a combination of the following characters: the purplish flower, the rounded apex of the dorsal sepal, the outer surface of dorsal sepal covered with irregular papillae in the upper half, the lateral sepals adnate laterally at the base to the connate petals, the V-shaped throat, the labellum bearing short hairs, dentate to erose labellum margins, and well-developed conical spurs. A key to the species of Corybas in Thailand is presented.</p>

		    <title>Leaf epidermal micromorphology defining the clades in Cinnamomum (Lauraceae)</title>

					<p>Authors: Zeng Gang, Bing Liu, Jens G. Rohwer, David Kay Ferguson, Yong Yang</p>
					<p>Abstract: In this study, we sampled 48 species of Asian Cinnamomum covering the species groups that were identified in recent phylogenetic studies and conducted leaf micromorphological observations using both light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Synapomorphies were determined by means of mapping micromorphological characters on a phylogenetic tree. The results indicate that Cinnamomum exhibits two different types of leaf upper epidermis: Type I has smooth/non-reticulate periclinal walls whereas Type II has reticulate periclinal walls and is unusual in the family Lauraceae. We found that the two types of micromorphological characters are clade-specific, sect. Camphora s.s. possesses Type I leaf upper epidermis, and sect. Cinnamomum s.l. has Type II leaf upper epidermis. Our study also reveals that C. saxatile, a member of sect. Camphora s.l. in the traditional classification, actually has Type II leaf upper epidermis, thus reinforcing the result of a recent molecular phylogeny that has this species in a clade consisting mainly of species of sect. Cinnamomum.</p>

					<p>Authors: Xin-Xin Feng, Yan Xiao, Zhi-Xian Liu, Ren-Kun Li, Dan Wei, Dai-Ke Tian</p>
					<p>Abstract: Begonia pseudoedulis, a new species in Begonia sect. Platycentrum (Klotzsch) A.DC. (Begoniaceae) from southern Guangxi of China, is here described and illustrated. It morphologically resembles B. edulis H.Lév. and B. dielsiana E.Pritz. ex Diels but differs easily by its hairy petioles and inflorescences, and red hispidulous flower tepals, ovary and capsules. The molecular phylogenetic analysis based on ITS supported that the new species was a monophyletic lineage, separating from both B. dielsiana and B. edulis. Due to its isolated distribution with several small populations, which are possibly disturbed by human activities, the species is considered as “Near Threatened” (NT) according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species, Cyclorhiza puana J. Zhou &amp; Z.W. Liu (Apiaceae) from Sichuan Province of China, is described and illustrated here. Morphological comparisons with congeneric species revealed that it is distinguished by its slender habit, sparse annular scars, 4-pinnatisect leaf blade with ultimate segments linear (2–4×0.5–1 mm), subequal rays, oblong fruits with slightly thickened ribs, obconic stylopodium and slightly concave seed face. A molecular analysis based on nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences indicated that C. puana is genetically distinct from the other two species of the genus. A distribution map, as well as an updated key, are provided for the species of Cyclorhiza.</p>

					<p>Authors: Wei-Chih Chen, Chih-Chiang Wang, Kun-Cheng Chang</p>
					<p>Abstract: A revision of Nertera (Rubiaceae) in Taiwan was carried out by classical taxonomic methods and the presence of two endemic species was confirmed. Only one species, misapplied as N. granadensis, had been reported in the second edition of “Flora of Taiwan”, but there were two additional endemic species in this genus: N. nigricarpa and N. taiwaniana confirmed. Nertera nigricarpa is characterised by the entire leaf, purple-black petals, black fruits and dark-purple seeds with raised striate. Nertera taiwaniana has leaves with undulated margins, yellowish-green petals, red fruits and yellow-white seeds without striate. N. granadensis is excluded from the flora of this Island.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Youngia hangii T.Deng, D.G.Zhang, Qun Liu &amp; Z.M.Li, sp. nov., a new species of Asteraceae, is described and illustrated. It was collected in Wufeng County, Hubei Province, Eastern Central China. Youngia hangii is morphologically most similar to Y. rubida, but can be easily distinguished from the latter by capitula with 8–10 florets and the hairy leaf surface. Phylogenetic analyses, based on the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and one chloroplast marker (rps16), showed that Y. hangii and Y. rubida were sister species with good support. The results of both phylogenetic analysis and the morphological data support the specific rank of Y. hangii.</p>

					<p>Authors: Mateusz Rybak, Natalia Kochman-Kędziora, Łukasz Peszek</p>
					<p>Abstract: The knowledge about terrestrial diatom assemblages in southern Africa is rather limited, despite a long history of diatom research in this area. Terrestrial habitats are places of characteristic diatom floras, dominated by species resistant to desiccation which are able to thrive in conditions of limited water availability. The presented work expands the knowledge about these unique habitats. During the study on terrestrial moss-inhabiting diatoms from Western Cape Province (South Africa), four taxa with a unique set of valve features have been found and described herein as new species, based on light and scanning electron microscopy. These new species are: Luticola microcephala M. Rybak, Peszek &amp; Kochman-Kędziora, sp. nov., Luticola asymmetrica M. Rybak, Kochman-Kędziora &amp; Peszek, sp. nov., Luticola terrestris Kochman-Kędziora, M. Rybak &amp; Peszek, sp. nov. and Microcostatus meridionalis Peszek, M. Rybak &amp; Kochman-Kędziora, sp. nov. Algal community composition had low species richness (9–15 taxa per sample) and samples were dominated by: Humidophila contenta, Nitzschia brevissima and Eunotia aff. pseudominor. The three new Luticola species formed numerous populations, exceeding 10% of the share, whereas Microcostatus meridionalis reached 5.4%. Basic morphological data of associated diatom flora together with detailed micrographs are also provided.</p>

		    <title>The genus Deschampsia and the epithet “ alpina”</title>

					<p>Authors: Jorge O. Chiapella, Zhi-Qing Xue, Josef Greimler</p>
					<p>Abstract: The epithet “alpina” has been recurrently used in the genus Deschampsia to name plants located in northern regions of Europe, Asia and North America, as a species (Deschampsia alpina (L.) Roem. &amp; Schult.), but also in infraspecific categories (Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. alpina Tzvel. and Deschampsia cespitosa var. alpina Schur.). The morphological and molecular available evidence suggests the existence of a single species, Deschampsia cespitosa (L.) P. Beauv., in which individuals belonging to the same morphological gradient have received different names in different taxonomic categories throughout its wide distribution range. An evaluation of the available names indicates that all uses of the epithet “alpina” are illegitimate. A new combination is proposed at the infraspecific level as Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. neoalpina Chiapella, Xue &amp; Greimler.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Molecular phylogenetic studies of Hosta pulchella (Asparagaceae) and its relatives, which are native to Japan, have been conducted and resulted in a highly resolved phylogeny. Specifically, the relationship of H. pulchella to H. alata Hatusima, nom. nud. is investigated. These data include genome-wide SNPs obtained through conducting multiplexed ISSR genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq). Based on these phylogenetic results, morphological observations, distribution, and differences in flowering periods of H. alata collections sympatric with H. pulchella, we find the two species closely related, but distinct. As such, we formally describe Hosta alata sp. nov. from the Oita Prefecture of Kyushu island, southwestern Japan.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Within the legume family, the taxonomic status of subtribe Glycyrrhizinae of tribe Galegeae and of the genus Adinobotrys has been re-assessed. Based on genome skimming data, we conducted phylogenomic analyses of the inverted repeat-lacking clade within subfamily Papilionoideae. The results support the sister relationship between Glycyrrhizeae and Adinobotrys. Glycyrrhizeae is resurrected based on Glycyrrhiza and Glycyrrhizopsis, and a new tribe, Adinobotryeae, is proposed to accommodate Adinobotrys.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Tovomitopsis Planch. &amp; Triana is a Brazilian Atlantic Forest endemic genus composed of two species: T. paniculata (Spreng.) Planch. &amp; Triana and T. saldanhae Engl. An investigation was conducted to clarify the nomenclatural history of Tovomitopsis. We report the results of this investigation, provide an updated description of the genus, and propose lectotypes for T. paniculata and its synonyms: Tovomita foliosa C.Presl and Tovomita paniculata Cambess. We also propose lectotypes for T. saldanhae and for the new synonym Clusia angustifolia Engl.</p>

					<p>Authors: Pablo Moroni, Agustina Martínez, Michael G. Simpson</p>
					<p>Abstract: During the preparation of the treatment of the genus Cryptantha Lehmann ex G. Don for South America, numerous names were identified as needing typification to stabilize their nomenclature. As a result, lectotypes are designated for 11 names and second-step lectotypes for 20 names. Furthermore, supporting information about the type material of the basionyms of four Cryptantha names already typified by Johnston (Eritrichium talquinum Phil., Eritrichium dimorphum Phil., Eritrichium carrizalense Phil., and Eritrichium subamplexicaule Phil.) is provided.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Three new species of Lepanthes from Ecuador are described and illustrated. These additions to the Ecuadorean flora were recorded in evergreen montane forest and páramo as part of three different research projects conducted during the last five years (2016–2021). Lepanthes oro-lojaensis was discovered in the southwest of El Oro province and is similar to L. jimburae, differing mainly in the much smaller plants, inflorescences and floral parts. Lepanthes microprosartima from the western slopes of Pichincha volcano in northern Ecuador resembles L. obandoi but differs in the coloration of the leaves, the inflorescence that are shorter than the leaves and the smaller floral appendix. Lepanthes caranqui, found in eastern Pichincha and Imbabura, is most similar to L. pachychila but differs from it in its much larger plants and different shape of the petals and the floral appendix. Preliminary assessments of the conservation status of the three taxonomic novelties are provided, using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria.</p>

					<p>Authors: Pierre-Emmanuel DuPasquier, Véronique Andro-Durand, Lucas Batory, Wei Wang, Florian Jabbour</p>
					<p>Abstract: Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have indicated that Aconitella is embedded in Consolida, which in turn is embedded in Delphinium. We choose not to split the genus Delphinium (c. 300 species), as it is horticulturally and pharmaceutically important, by conserving a broad Delphinium by transferring the names from Consolida and Aconitella to Delphinium s.lat., and more precisely in the resurrected D. subg. Consolida. Including 58 species of Aconitella and Consolida within Delphinium causes fewer nomenclatural overall changes than do alternative schemes because most of the species of Aconitella and Consolida were once named under the name Delphinium. We present here the list of synonyms for the species once named under Consolida or Aconitella and gather the information relative to the types of these names. Two new combinations are provided, and 21 lectotypes are designated here.</p>

		    <title>Diversity of leaf anatomy within a single leaflet and between leaflets of four Butia (Arecaceae, Arecoideae) species</title>

					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.180.66018</p>
					<p>Authors: Larry R. Noblick, Bruno F. Sant’anna-Santos</p>
					<p>Abstract: This paper is an investigation into how the anatomy changes within a leaflet and between the leaflets of a single leaf blade of Butia. Four species of Butia were studied: Butia paraguayensis, B. eriospatha, B. yatay and B. odorata. Changes in the anatomical characters are important because some have been used in keys to help separate the species. Recently, anatomical mid-rib characters were used in a key to separate species of Butia. We found that characters, such as abaxially projected or rounded mid-rib fibrous ring or number and arrangement of accessory bundles, do change within a single leaflet or between the leaflets of a single leaf blade. Growing conditions and leaf developmental maturity are also important factors that influence leaflet anatomy and may cause one to be misled in an identification key based on anatomical characters. We re-emphasize the importance of always sampling from the same part of the leaf, to have a broader sampling, be attentive to the environmental condition and health of the plant from which you are sampling and to consider population differences.</p>

					<p>Abstract: The first ever liverwort and hornwort checklist is provided for the Kepulauan Sunda Kecil (Lesser Sunda Islands) of Indonesia and Timor-Leste (East Timor). We report 129 accepted taxa, 12 doubtful taxa and three rejected taxa previously reported for the Lesser Sunda Islands. The list is based on over 130 literature references, including monographs, regional studies, and molecular investigations. It is clear that bryophytes from this region have been overlooked historically, and under collected, compared to seed plants, birds, and other organisms, forming a remarkable gap in the flora of Indonesia. Publications dealing with liverworts of Lesser Sunda Islands are few and scattered. We predict that further fieldwork, in addition to collections unveiled from regional herbaria, will uncover a number of new records that remain to be reported, especially considering that regionally widespread species have been recorded elsewhere.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Vaccinium exiguum from the ultramafic summit of Mt. Victoria, Palawan Island, Philippines is here described as a new species of Ericaceae. It closely resembles V. hamiguitanense but is distinct by having much shorter petioles and leaves, longer and glabrous calyx lobes with serrate lobe margins, a larger corolla with deeper sulcations, and longer stamens with spurs oriented laterally. Vaccinium exiguum represents the third Vaccinium species found on the Island of Palawan and 36th in the Philippines.</p>

					<p>Authors: Zhi Yang, Wei-Yin Jin, Bing Liu, David Kay Ferguson, Yong Yang</p>
					<p>Abstract: We collected an unusual new plant of Phoebe (Lauraceae) from southeastern Yunnan, China, which possesses more or less oblong leaves, paniculate inflorescences with strictly opposite lateral cymes, trimerous flowers with 4-locular stamens, and large fruits with tiny, equal, persistent tepals. Our molecular phylogenetic study based on nrITS, LEAFY and plastid matK sequences suggests that this species belongs to a clade of Phoebe including P. puwenensis, P. megacalyx, and P. macrocarpa. However, this species differs from the latter three species by subglabrous twigs, leaves and inflorescences (vs. pubescent twigs, leaves and inflorescences in the latter three species), larger fruits (5–8 cm long vs. 1–4 cm long in the latter three species), and smaller tepals (1–2.5 mm long vs. 5–15 mm long in the latter two species). As a result, Phoebe jinpingensis sp. nov. is described and illustrated here as new to science.</p>

					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.179.66312</p>
					<p>Authors: Birol Başer, Mehmet Sagıroglu, Gulden Dogan, Hayri Duman</p>
					<p>Abstract: In this study, the pollen morphology of all Ferula species distributed throughout the country of Turkey was studied with light and scanning electron microscopy for the first time. The aim is to identify the pollen morphological characteristics of 23 Ferula species. The pollen is radially symmetrical, isopolar and tricolporate in all examined species. Pollen grains are prolate and perprolate with the polar axis ranging from 22.28 to 40.47 µm and the equatorial axis from 13.70 to 18.73 µm. Their polar shapes are triangular, triangular to subtriangular and circular to subcircular. Several types of exine ornamentations have been observed on pollen through the use of scanning electron microscopy. The dendrogram constructed by using Average Linkage of the examined data revealed two main groups. It was determined that some pollen characteristics are more useful for classification than others. In particular, P, E, the ratio of P/E (pollen shape) and ornamentation in the polar and equatorial views are the most valuable variables for discrimination the Ferula species.</p>

					<p>Authors: John L. Clark, Lou Jost</p>
					<p>Abstract: Recent studies of type specimens and exploratory research expeditions in the northern Andes have resulted in an updated circumscription and recognition for two species of Kohleria (Gesneriaceae) in Ecuador and Colombia. A change in the rank from a variety to species is recognized for Kohleria anisophylla (Fritsch) Wiehler. The combination Kohleria andina (Fritsch) J.L. Clark &amp; Jost, comb. nov. is provided here and a lectotype is designated. The updated circumscriptions of these two species are supported by morphology and geographic distribution. The presence of an epiphytic habit for Kohleria is discussed. Field images based on recent expeditions are provided to support the circumscriptions presented here.</p>

					<p>Abstract: We describe an extraordinary new species in the genus Thismia from the Terengganu State of Malaysia in the Malay Peninsula. The new species, which we name Thismia sitimeriamiae, is distinct from all other Thismia species known to science, most notably in its unique mitre configuration formed by the inner tepals and its floral surface morphology characterised by conspicuous orange trichomes. We discuss our findings in the context of underestimated species diversity in the genus Thismia and implications for their conservation. We recommend assigning T. sitimeriamiae the conservation status as Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria.</p>

					<p>Authors: Yi Yang, Hua Peng, Hang Sun</p>
					<p>Abstract: A taxonomic revision of Sageretia lucida, S. thea var. cordiformis and S. yunlongensis in China is presented. Sageretia lucida is revised in terms of morphological characters (habit, branchlet color, phyllotaxis and rachis length), distribution, habitat, and phenology; S. thea var. cordiformis is raised to S. cordiformis; and S. yunlongensis is excluded from the genus Sageretia and reduced to the synonym of Rhamnus nigricans. Furthermore, a new species, S. ellipsoidea, is erected based on the paratype collections of S. lucida. The new species morphologically differs from S. lucida in having reddish brown branchlets, opposite or subopposite phyllotaxis, shorter rachises, and flowering in spring or early summer. S. ellipsoidea is factually closest to S. hamosa as they share similar woody-vine habit and larger fruit size, and fruiting in winter, whereas the former can be easily recognized based on its smaller leaf blades, fewer lateral veins, shorter rachises, and ellipsoidal or elliptic-ovoid fruits.</p>

					<p>Abstract: This paper presents a taxonomic study of genus Vincetoxicum s.str. from southern Asia. Eleven regional endemic species are recognized on the basis of herbarium studies and fieldwork. Three new species are described: V. lenifolium sp. nov. (endemic to Pakistan), V. stewartianum sp. nov. (endemic to India), and V. subcanescens sp. nov. (endemic to Pakistan, Kashmir and Tibet). Three species names, V. cabulicum, V. glaucum and V. kenouriense, previously treated as synonyms of V. glaucum, V. canescens and V. hirundinaria, respectively, are resurrected. A neotype is designated for the Afghani endemic V. cabulicum. A lectotype is chosen from the syntypes of V. glaucum. We resolve the long-standing taxonomic problems in three species complexes: V. arnottianum, V. luridum, V. sakesarense, and V. stocksii; V. glaucum, V. canescens and V. cabulicum; and V. hirundinaria and V. kenouriense. Geo-taxonomic distinctions of southern Asian taxa are highlighted by excluding from henceforth the long misrecognized western Eurasian taxa V. canescens and V. hirundinaria. Furthermore, a detailed account of the genus including illustrations of whole plants, leaves and corona, distribution maps, a taxonomic key, morphological descriptions, synonymy, notes, and information on phenology, distribution and habitats is provided. Finally, provisional conservation assessments are provided, which indicate that V. cardiostephanum and V. sakesarense are critically endangered.</p>

					<p>Authors: Jun Wen, Zhi-Yao Ma</p>
					<p>Abstract: This study reports the recognition of Vitis adenoclada Hand.-Mazz. from southern China. The species was not recognized in the Flora Reipublicae Ropularis Sinicicae and Flora of China treatments. Recent field studies and examination of herbarium collections including the type material suggest that Vitis adenoclada is morphologically similar to V. heyneana, in their densely arachnoid tomentose abaxial leaves, yet it can be easily distinguished from the latter by its red-purple glandular hairs on the young branches (vs. glandular hairs absent in V. heyneana) and inflorescences usually subtended by a tendril at the base (vs. only occasionally with a tendril in V. heyneana). Vitis adenoclada may be a species of hybrid origin, with the highly tomentose Vitis heyneana as one of the parental species, and likely the glandular-hair bearing V. davidii as the other parental species. Vitis adenoclada is recorded from southern China in Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan and Zhejiang provinces.</p>

		    <title>An unknown hotspot of plant diversity in the heart of the Central Apennine: flora and vegetation outline of Mt. Pozzoni-St. Rufo valley (Cittareale, Rieti)</title>

					<p>Abstract: Surprisingly enough, Italy still has some botanically unexplored areas; among these there are some territories between Lazio, Umbria and Abruzzo not included in any protected area. The study area, ranging for 340 ha, includes the mountainous area of Mt. Pozzoni-Mt. Prato-St. Rufo valley, which forms the upper part of the river Velino basin, located in the territory of the municipality of Cittareale (Rieti, Lazio), at an elevation from 1150 to 1903 m a.s.l. The substrate is mainly made of marly limestone of the Meso-Cenozoic Umbria-Marche sedimentary succession. The climate is Temperate and comprises vegetation belts from the montane to sub-alpine. Land cover is dominated by pastures and deciduous forests, with only a few hay meadows. 794 entities have been detected: 16% are considered rare or very rare for the regional territory with several floristic novelties for the regional flora, 6% of the total was found to be endemic to Italy and only eight taxa were aliens. Four taxa are new for the regional flora of Lazio: Arum cylindraceum, Alopecurus pratensis subsp. pratensis, Hieracium bupleuroides and Trinia glauca subsp. glauca. Forest vegetation is represented by beech forests, while dry grasslands are the most widespread vegetation type. The greatest phytocoenotic diversity was found within the secondary pastures. Particularly interesting is the plant community with Iris marsica, which suggests that limestone mountain ledges can represent a primary habitat for this endemic species of the Central Apennine. The presence of several habitats listed in the EU Habitat Directive indicates how the lack of detailed territorial knowledge can lead to the non-designation of conservation sites in areas of high naturalistic value. These findings showed that botanical explorations in territories which are still not known could contribute significantly to the identification of areas of high interest in conserving plant diversity.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Otoba is the third largest genus of Myristicaceae in the Neotropics with 12 species, nine of them native to Colombia. Two new species from the department of Antioquia, O. scottmorii sp. nov. and O. squamosa sp. nov., are described and illustrated. Otoba scottmorii occurs in humid, lowland forests, while O. squamosa occurs in premontane forest. Previously, Otoba scottmorii was confused with O. acuminata (which here is considered restricted to Costa Rica and Panama), while O. squamosa was confused with O. gordoniifolia. The similarities and differences between these and other species are discussed.</p>

					<p>Authors: Zuo-Ying Wei, Zeng-Qiang Xia, Xian-Chun Zhang, Jian-Guo Cao, Yue-Hong Yan</p>
					<p>Abstract: Although taxonomists target the remote wild regions to discover new species, taxa lacking a comprehensive and modern systematic treatment may be the new hotspot for biodiversity discovery. The development of molecular systematics integrated with microscopic observation techniques has greatly improved the ability of taxonomists to identify species correctly. Vittaria centrochinensis Ching ex J.F. Cheng, regarded as a synonym of Haplopteris fudzinoi (Makino) E.H.Crane, remained hidden from the eyes of fern taxonomists for more than 20 years. Herein, we collected several population samples of V. centrochinensis by performing molecular phylogenetic analysis of five cpDNA regions (rbcL, atpA, matK, ndhF, and trnL-trnF) and through micromophological observation of specimens which differs from H. fudzinoi by lamina width and exospores. Considering the differences in morphology, geographical range, and genetic distance between these two species, we formally recognized V. centrochinensis as an authentic species and proposed a new combination Haplopteris centrochinensis (Ching ex J.F.Cheng) Y.H.Yan, Z.Y.Wei &amp; X.C.Zhang, comb. nov. Our findings demonstrate that several taxa in synonyms are missing, and nowadays taxonomy should also include re-evaluation of the past taxonomy.</p>

					<p>Abstract: During a taxonomic study of Anthurium sect. Pachyneurium, it was found that the names of four species required typification. Verification of the protologues and cited collections is discussed and typifications are proposed as follows: the illustration Schott Icones Aroideae No. 465 is designated as the neotype of A. affine Schott. A lectotype is designated for A. bonplandii G.S.Bunting since the holotype, cited in the protologue at MY, was not found there. An epitype is selected for A. solitarium Schott because the lectotype illustration of J.M.C. Vellozo (Flora Fluminensis t. 123) lacks sufficient detail to determine it unambiguously to species in A. sect. Pachyneurium. A lectotype is selected for A. glaziovii Hook.f., a synonym of A. solitarium.</p>

		    <title>          Artabotrys pachypetalus (Annonaceae), a new species from China</title>

					<p>Authors: Bine Xue, Gang-Tao Wang, Xin-Xin Zhou, Yi Huang, Yi Tong, Yongquan Li, Junhao Chen</p>
					<p>Abstract: Artabotrys pachypetalus sp. nov. is described from Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan and Jiangxi in China. A detailed description, distribution data, along with a color plate and a line drawing are provided. In China, specimens representing this species were formerly misidentified as A. multiflorus or A. hongkongensis (= A. blumei). Artabotrys blumei typically has a single flower per inflorescence, whereas both Artabotrys pachypetalus and A. multiflorus have multiple flowers per inflorescence. In addition, A. pachypetalus is readily distinguished from A. multiflorus in having thicker and shorter petals, and connivent and somewhat trigonal or terete inner petal blades. Artabotrys pachypetalus is most similar to A. punctulatus because both have multi-flowered inflorescences and similar petal length, but A. pachypetalus differs in having cream petals in vivo, connivent inner petal blades, and a short, raised rim above the inner petal claw. Artabotrys multiflorus should be excluded from the flora of China because none of the Chinese specimens of Artabotrys collected so far fall within the variation of A. multiflorus.</p>

					<p>Authors: Olena P. Bilous, Sergey I. Genkal, Jonas Zimmermann, Wolf-Henning Kusber, Regine Jahn</p>
					<p>Abstract: The diversity of centric diatoms is documented for the transitional zone of the lower part of the Southern Bug River (Ukraine) just before entering the Dnipro-Bug Estuary and compared to earlier results from the upstream sampling sites of the same river system. Benthic samples of the following sites were investigated: north of Mykolaiv City (approximately 5 km), in Mykolaiv City (near Varvarivskyi Bridge), and 5 km south of the city. Twenty-four centric diatom taxa belonging to 11 genera were identified, analysed, and documented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). Among them, Aulacoseira nivalis is the first report for Ukraine, A. islandica and is the first confirmed record for the studied area since the 1930s. The maximum number of centric diatom taxa found in one station was 21, the minimum 10. Melosira subglobosa was the most common (documented in 57–80% of sites with centric diatoms) and abundant species 7.3–15.7% in relative abundance to all diatom taxa. The discovered diversity of taxa and its comparison with previous results is discussed with regard to the relevance of estuary zones in the research of diatoms.</p>

		    <title>Hybridization of Oxalis corniculata and O. dillenii in their non-native range</title>
		    <link>https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/61031/</link>

					<p>Authors: Quentin Groom, Sofie Meeus, Steven B. Janssens, Leen Leus, Ivan Hoste</p>
					<p>Abstract: Many species have been introduced beyond their native ranges and many have become global weeds. Human mediated dispersal has removed the geographic isolation of these species, reversing millions of years of independent evolution. Examples are the Oxalis species in section Corniculatae where several species have become invasive. Here we characterize and formally describe a hybrid between O. dillenii and O. corniculata, which occurs spontaneously in Belgium and Japan. Oxalis corniculata is probably native to Japan, but both species are alien to Belgium and O. dillenii is native to North America. We formally name this hybrid as Oxalis × vanaelstii. Although this hybrid is sterile, it is nevertheless vigorous and perennial. Both parent species grow as weeds in gardens; therefore, it is likely to be more common than currently appreciated in countries where these species co-occur.</p>

		    <title>On a noteworthy habitat type in the savannahs of Central Cuba and a remarkable new species of Elytraria (Acanthaceae)</title>

					<p>Authors: Werner Greuter, Rankin Rodríguez</p>
					<p>Abstract: A peculiar habitat type found in the savannahs of Central Cuba, Villa Clara Province and characterised by the presence of a surface gravel layer of “perdigones”, an assemblage of small ferralitic concretions, upon the “mocarrero” soil prevailing in the area, is described. On sterile gravel patches, only one species grows: Elytraria serpens, a new species described and named here. It is noteworthy for possessing long and wide creeping, stoloniform subterranean peduncles with apical gemmae developing into rooting leaf rosettes enabling vegetative propagation. The new species is close to E. shaferi and considered to derive from the latter by adaptive evolution, enabling it to survive in its hostile habitat, sheltered from the competition of other plant species. Small soil insects, for example, ants, are believed to act as pollinators.</p>

		    <title>Taxonomic revision of Martinella Baill. (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae)</title>

		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>PhytoKeys 177: 77-116</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.177.64465</p>
					<p>Authors: Eric Y. Kataoka, Lúcia G. Lohmann</p>
					<p>Abstract: Martinella Baill. is a genus of Neotropical lianas in tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae). The genus is monophyletic and well supported by morphological and molecular characters. Members of Martinella are characterized by a continuous interpetiolar ridge surrounding the stem, bilobed or 4–5-parted calyces, and minute triangular prophylls of the axillary buds. Generic circumscription remained unchanged since the description of the genus, although unclear species limits remained. Based on extensive fieldwork, herbarium work, and a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus, we here recognize five species of Martinella. Of these, three were recognized in earlier treatments for the genus, while two represent new species described here, Martinella lanuginosa Kataoka &amp; L.G.Lohmann, sp. nov. and Martinella tomentosa Kataoka &amp; L.G.Lohmann, sp. nov. Martinella iquitoensis A.Samp. is treated as a synonym of M. insculpta Sprague &amp; Sandwith. In addition, one second-step lectotype is designated for Bignonia martini DC., and neotypes are designated for Doxantha longisiliqua Miers and Martinella gollmeri K.Schum. This work provides a full taxonomic treatment for Martinella, including a complete list of synonyms, morphological descriptions, illustrations, photographs, distribution maps, conservation status, and comments for all five species recognized.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Chayamaritia vietnamensis, a new species from Son La Province, northern Vietnam, is described and illustrated. The phylogenetic study revealed that the new species is most closely related to C. banksiae and C. smitinandii. The morphological comparison suggests it as the third new species of Chayamaritia and distinguished from C. banksiae and C. smitinandii by a combination of morphological characters of leaf blades, bracts, calyx and corolla, especially its peltate leaf blades. This species is provisionally assessed as endangered (EN B1ab(iii), B2ab(iii)) using IUCN Categories and Criteria. Information on ecology, phenology and an identification key for the known Chayamaritia species are also provided.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Carpinus polyneura and C. dayongina are recognised as separate species in Flora of China. In this study, the results of an examination of literature, morphological comparison and phenetic clustering of nuclear ITS sequences suggest that C. dayongina is conspecific with C. polyneura.

		    <title>Evaluating the monophyly of Mammillaria series Supertextae (Cactaceae)</title>
		    <link>https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/62915/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>PhytoKeys 177: 25-42</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.177.62915</p>
					<p>Authors: Cristian R. Cervantes, Silvia Hinojosa-Alvarez, Ana Wegier, Ulises Rosas, Salvador Arias</p>
					<p>Abstract: Mammillaria (Cactaceae) taxonomy has been historically problematic due to the morphological variability and sympatry of the species. This has led to several proposals for infrageneric classification, including subgeneric, section and series categories. Mammillaria ser. Supertextae is one of 15 series and is made up of a variable set of species that are mainly distributed in southern Mexico and Central America. However, the phylogenetic relationships within M. ser. Supertextae and its relationship to other Mammillaria taxa are far from fully understood. Here we attempt to elucidate these relationships using complete terminal sampling and newly obtained chloroplast marker sequences and comparing them to Mammillaria species sequences from GenBank. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that M. ser. Supertextae comprises a well-supported monophyletic group that diverged approximately 2.1 Mya and has M. ser. Polyacanthae as its sister group; however, relationships within M. ser. Supertextae remain unresolved. The topology obtained within M. ser. Supertextae must also be interpreted under the distribution shared by these taxa, but it is difficult to differentiate ancestral polymorphisms from possible introgression, given the short time elapsed and the markers used. Our results show that the infrageneric units of M. haageana and M. albilanata can be considered independent evolutionary units. We also suggest that the relationship between M. haageana and M. albilanata is convoluted because their distribution overlaps (mainly towards southern Mexico), with genetic differences that possibly indicate they represent more than two taxonomic entities. One possible explanation is that there could still be gene flow between these taxa, and we might be witnessing an ongoing speciation process.</p>

					<p>Authors: Grzegorz J. Wolski, Jarosław Proćków</p>
					<p>Abstract: In 2020, Plagiothecium mauiense Broth. was recognised as a synonym of P. longisetum Lindb.; however, due to the inability to compare all known original material, the conducted taxonomic analysis was not completed with lectotypification of the name. Syntypes of P. mauiense were found in four American herbaria: Harvard University Herbarium (FH00220142), Miami University Herbarium (MU 000000546), New York Botanical Garden Herbarium (NY01256708) and Yale University Herbarium (YU 233890). Considering the condition of the found material and Articles 9.3, 9.11 and 9.12 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (Shenzhen Code) that is currently in force, a specimen NY01256708 was proposed to be the lectotype of P. mauiense.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Lycoris wulingensis S.Y. Zhang, a new species from Hunan Province (central South China), is described and illustrated. This new species is a fertile diploid plant and its karyotype is 2n = 22. It is most similar to L. × haywardii in morphology, but the latter is a hybrid species and distributed in East China and the plant is much larger. Amongst the original species, L. wulingensis is similar to L. radiata, but differs from it in its flowers being rose-red (vs. red) and stamens and tepals are nearly the same length (vs. stamens significantly longer than tepals).</p>

		    <title>Integrating continental mainland and islands in temperate East Asia: liverworts and hornworts of the Korean Peninsula</title>
		    <link>https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/56874/</link>

					<p>PhytoKeys 176: 131-226</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.176.56874</p>
					<p>Authors: Seung Se Choi, Vadim Bakalin, Seung Jin Park</p>
					<p>Abstract: The liverwort and hornwort flora of the Korean Peninsula possesses some unique traits arising from the geographic position of the Peninsula, where the mainland flora meets insular flora. This flora is still not exhaustively studied, due not only to political reasons, but also because much less attention has been paid than to adjacent lands by hepaticologists. A checklist presented is based on a study of ca. 15,500 specimens collected by the authors and a review of relevant literature. This study provides the checklist of liverworts and hornworts known from Korea and the geographical distribution of each species within the peninsula. The liverworts and hornworts in Korean flora include 346 taxa (326 species, 16 subspecies and four varieties) in 112 genera and 50 families. Since 2007, 75 taxa of liverworts and four taxa of hornworts are reported as new to the Korean Peninsula, with a number of the new records arising following application of new taxonomic concepts that have become apparent over the last few decades. While compiling the checklist, 42 species, previously reported to Korea, are excluded from the Korean liverwort flora.</p>

					<p>PhytoKeys 176: 111-129</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.176.62774</p>
					<p>Authors: Fabio Conti, Fabrizio Bartolucci</p>
					<p>Abstract: A new species of Anthyllis endemic to central Apennine growing in dry pastures on limestone in the montane belt, within Abruzzo and Lazio administrative regions (central Italy), is here described and illustrated and the IUCN assessment is proposed. This new species belongs to the morphologically very variable Anthyllis vulneraria species complex and it is close to A. pulchella (south-eastern Europe and Caucasus), but it can be clearly distinguished by its smaller flowers, mainly light yellow-coloured, bracts longer than flowers, calyx pink-coloured (usually only at apex) and size of cauline leaves and leaflets. Furthermore, the name A. pulchella is here lectotypified, by a second-step typification, on a specimen preserved at PAD.</p>

					<p>PhytoKeys 176: 1-19</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.176.63378</p>
					<p>Authors: Ju Eun Jang, Jong-Soo Park, Ji-Young Jung, Dong-Kap Kim, Sungyu Yang, Hyeok Jae Choi</p>
					<p>Abstract: Allium section Rhizirideum is reviewed for South Korea and neighboring northeastern China based on critical observation of wild populations and herbarium materials. Species delimitations are re-evaluated on the basis of morphological and somatic chromosome numbers, resulting in the recognition of five species. Allium dumebuchum from Ulleungdo Island, South Korea, is described as a new species. This species is most similar to A. senescens due to its habits, but is clearly distinguished particularly by its rhomboid scapes in cross-secion, light purple perianth color, entire and narrowly triangular inner filaments, and flowering season from late September. One previously recognized species is placed into synonymy: A. pseudosenescens (under A. senescens). Photographs and a key to species of Allium section Rhizirideum in South Korea and northeastern China are provided in addition to information on nomenclatural types, synonymies, chromosome numbers, distribution, and specimens examined.</p>

					<p>PhytoKeys 176: 21-32</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.176.62802</p>
					<p>Authors: Long-Fei Fu, Tian-Ge Yang, De-qing Lan, Fang Wen, Hong Liu</p>
					<p>Abstract: Chrysosplenium sangzhiense Hong Liu, a new species from Hunan, China, is described and illustrated. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new species belongs to subgen. Chrysosplenium and is closely related to C. grayanum, C. nepalense and C. sinicum. The chromosome number of the new species is 2n = 46, indicating a novel basic number x = 23 in Chrysosplenium that is different from other species. This also suggests that C. sangzhiense is probably an allopolyploid derivative of a species with x = 11 and one with x = 12. Morphologically, C. sangzhiense can be easily distinguished from C. grayanum, C. nepalense, C. sinicum and C. cavaleriei, a species not included in our phylogenetic analysis by a suite of characters relating to the sterile shoots, basal leaves, cauline leaves, flowering stem, sepals, disc, capsule and seed. A global conservation assessment is performed, and classifies C. sangzhiense as Least Concern (LC).</p>

					<p>Authors: Si-Jin Zeng, Ye-Chun Xu, Gang-Tao Wang, Peng Jia, Da-Fang Cui</p>
					<p>Abstract: A new species of the genus Tigridiopalma, formerly considered monotypic, is here described as T. exalata and illustrated based on molecular and morphological evidence. It is morphologically similar to T. magnifica in having a short stem, huge basal leaves, scorpioid cymes, and 5-merous flowers, but differs in having ribbed and pale yellow puberulent petioles, purple petals with a small white apical patch, connectives of longer stamens with a distinct dorsal short spur at their base, and wingless capsules. Due to the restricted distribution, small populations and horticultural potential of this new species, it should be categorized as an Endangered species (EN).</p>

					<p>Abstract: Viola huizhouensis (Violaceae), a new species from Xiangtoushan National Nature Reserve of Guangdong Province in China, is described and illustrated. The new species is most similar to V. guangzhouensis, but it can be easily distinguished by its much stouter rhizome, lack of aerial stem, dense pubescence of the basal pedicel and the whole plant. Our phylogenetic analysis, based on ITS sequences, confirms that the new species belongs to V. sect. Diffusae.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species Saussurea talungensis S.K.Ghimire &amp; H.K.Rana, sp. nov. (sect. Strictae), from Talung valley of Humla district, Nepal, is described and illustrated. Morphologically, this species resembles Saussurea roylei and Saussurea lanata in habit, though it can be distinguished in having longer leaf petioles, purplish leaf margin, 1 or 3 capitula, shorter phyllaries, shorter receptacle bristles and the same anthers, comparatively shorter corolla with shorter lobes. Phylogenomic analysis also supports S. talungensis as a distinct species of Saussurea. Here, we provide taxonomic note, distribution map and phylogenomic inference to distinguish the new species and its allied members.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Impatiens wutaishanensis R.L. Liao &amp; Lei Cai, a new species from Southeast Yunnan, China, is here described and illustrated. This new species is most similar to Impatiens parvisepala S.X. Yu &amp; Y.T. Hou in its racemose inflorescences, its four lateral sepals, the leaf arrangement, and in having yellow flowers. However, it differs in the height of the plants, the length of the petiole, the size and shape of the leaf blade, the shape of the spur, and the number of flowers in each inflorescence. A detailed description, color photographs, and a provisional IUCN red list assessment are provided, and its geographical distribution, ecology, and morphological relationship with relevant similar species are discussed.</p>

		    <title>A new synonym of Polygonatum in China, based on morphological and molecular evidence</title>

					<p>Authors: Maoqin Xia, Ying Liu, Jingjing Liu, Donghong Chen, Yan Shi, Zhicong Bai, Yu Xiao, Chen Peng, Jinping Si, Pan Li, Yingxiong Qiu</p>
					<p>Abstract: Polygonatum kingianum Collett et Hemsl. var. grandifolium D.M. Liu &amp; W.Z. Zeng (1981), which sprouts twice a year, once in spring and once in autumn, differs from Polygonatum kingianum in leaves, bracts, perianth and filaments. Morphological comparison and molecular phylogeny indicate that it is identical to the newly-published Polygonatum hunanense H.H. Liu &amp; B.Z. Wang (2021). Hence, we propose that P. kingianum var. grandifolium should be recognised as a new synonym of P. hunanense. In addition, phylogenetic analyses confirmed that P. hunanense is sister to Polygonatum sect. Polygonatum, rather than P. kingianum of Polygonatum sect. Verticillata.</p>

		    <title>A checklist of vascular plants of Ewe-Adakplame Relic Forest in Benin, West Africa</title>

					<p>PhytoKeys 175: 151-174</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/phytokeys.175.61467</p>
					<p>Authors: Alfred Houngnon, Aristide C. Adomou, William D. Gosling, Peter A. Adeonipekun</p>
					<p>Abstract: Covering 560.14 hectares in the south-east of Benin, the Ewe-Adakplame Relic Forest (EARF) is a micro-refugium that shows insular characteristics within the Dahomey Gap. It is probably one of the last remnants of tropical rain forest that would have survived the late Holocene dry period. Based on intensive field investigations through 25 plots (10 × 50 m size) and matching of herbarium specimens, a checklist of 185 species of vascular plant belonging to 54 families and 142 genera is presented for this forest. In addition to the name for each taxon, we described the life form following Raunkiaer’s definitions, chorology as well as threats to habitat. The Rubiaceae family was the richest (20 species) followed by the Fabaceae (15 species). Life forms showed the preponderance of phanerophytes (88%). The Chorological spectrum was dominated by Guineo-Congolean species (66%). Species richness estimated were 200.52 ± 9.2808 for Bootstrap; 217.62 ± 14.5972; 224.16 ± 15.3725 and 242.67 respectively for Chao, Jacknife1 and Jacknife2. Bootstrap appears to be the estimation closer to the field records. In Benin, EARF is home for Rinorea species described as West African forest bio-indicators and single location for Nesogordonia papaverifera, Mansonia altissima, Englerophytum oblanceolatum, Octolobus spectabilis, Vitex micrantha and most of Drypeteae tribe species (Drypetes aframensis, Drypetes afzelii, Drypetes gilgiana and Drypetes leonensis) recorded in Benin. Our results provides baseline information for further in-depth analysis of vegetation history in Benin by raising the question on the past floristic connection of the Dahomey gap and community engagement in conservation.</p>
