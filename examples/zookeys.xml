					<p>Authors: Dmitry Telnov, Evgeny E. Perkovsky, Dmitry V. Vasilenko, Shûhei Yamamoto</p>
					<p>Abstract: Glesoconomorphus ekaterinae sp. nov. (Coleoptera, Mycteridae), representing the first ever fossil species of Coleoptera from the Volyn Region of Ukraine and the first mycterid from late Eocene Rovno amber, is described and illustrated. A key to species of the fossil mycterid genus Glesoconomorphus Alekseev, Pollock &amp; Bukejs, 2019 is presented. The systematic position of Glesoconomorphus within Eurypinae J. Thomson, 1860 is briefly discussed. The oldest finding of phoretic Winterschmidtiidae Oudemans, 1923 mites, found on the type specimen of the new beetle species, is reported.</p>

		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1068: 149-187</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1068.73549</p>
					<p>Authors: Paolo Rosa, Maxim Yu. Proshchalykin, Marek Halada</p>
					<p>Abstract: An addendum to the recent checklist of the Chrysididae from Mongolia is given. Examination of old museum material and recently collected specimens has led to the discovery of eight new records for the country and eleven new species for science. Eight species are newly recorded from Mongolia: Chrysis inclinata Linsenmaier, 1959, C. martinella du Buysson, 1900, C. speciosa Radoszkowski, 1877, Euchroeus purpuratus (Fabricius, 1787), Holopyga lucida (Lepeletier, 1806), H. similis Mocsáry, 1889, Hedychridium femoratum (Dahlbom, 1854) and H. leleji Rosa, 2017. Two species, Hedychridium cupreum (Dahlbom, 1845) and H. propodeale Rosa, 2017 are excluded from the checklist of Mongolian Chrysididae: the former is described here as H. erythrosoma sp. nov., the latter is identified as H. leleji Rosa, 2017. The hitherto unknown male of Chrysis mocsaryi Radoszkowski, 1889 is described and illustrated. Eleven new species are described: Chrysis strakai sp. nov., C. woodi sp. nov., Hedychridium erythrosoma sp. nov., H. frontale sp. nov., H. jacobsi sp. nov., H. splendens sp. nov., H. striatum sp. nov., H. varvarae sp. nov., H. weii sp. nov., Holopyga tyrneri sp. nov., and Philoctetes boreki sp. nov. Keys to males and females of all known Mongolian species of Hedychridium Abeille de Perrin, 1878 are provided. The Mongolian cuckoo wasp fauna now comprises 107 species in 18 genera and two subfamilies.</p>

		    <title>A checklist of Mantodea of Belize, with a regional key to species</title>
		    <link>https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/58193/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1068: 51-71</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1068.58193</p>
					<p>Authors: Lohitashwa Garikipati, Jason E. Bond</p>
					<p>Abstract: The list of known Mantodea in Belize is updated, with notes of 12 new country records, bringing the total known species of Mantodea in Belize to 21. Further information on habitat and microhabitat observations are included. A regional dichotomous key and Lucid interactive key are provided to known species in Belize. A list of other possibly endemic species is provided. Remarks on the merit of further sampling efforts in central America are made, based on recent studies. Our findings suggest that our understanding of Central American Mantodean diversity could be vastly improved by further documentation.</p>

		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1068: 27-40</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1068.72805</p>
					<p>Authors: Xin Xu, Xianjin Peng, Daiqin Li</p>
					<p>Abstract: We diagnose and describe four new species of Portia Karsch, 1878 and describe for the first time the male of P. zhaoi Peng, Li &amp; Chen, 2003 from China based on morphological characters. The females of Portia bawang sp. nov. have the narrowest epigyne orifice. The males of Portia erlangping sp. nov. have the shortest embolus among all the species. The females of Portia fajing sp. nov. can be distinguished from other species by the anterior orifice margin, which is nearly parallel to the posterior orifice margin. The males of Portia xishan sp. nov. can be identified by the tegular furrow which extends to form a membrane and by the tegular apophysis which is obscured; the females of Portia xishan sp. nov. can be diagnosed by the slit-like epigynal orifice. The males of P. zhaoi have the longest embolus among all the species, and females can be diagnosed by the circular epigyne orifice and the longest copulatory ducts. To facilitate future identification, we also provide the GenBank accession codes of the DNA barcode gene, Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), for all the type specimens.</p>

					<p>ZooKeys 1068: 13-26</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1068.70717</p>
					<p>Authors: Ľuboš Hrivniak, Pavel Sroka, Jindriska Bojkova, Roman J. Godunko, Peter Manko</p>
					<p>Abstract: A new species, Epeorus (Caucasiron) hyrcanicus sp. nov., is described based on larval morphology and molecular data (COI) containing sequences from all Caucasian Caucasiron species described to date. The species is distributed in the Hyrcanian forest of southeastern Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran. Based on our wide-range sampling, the new species is likely endemic to this area. The most pronounced larval morphological diagnostic characters are the coloration pattern of abdominal sterna (a pair of oblique stripes and stripe-like medio-lateral maculae) and terga (triangular medial maculae), poorly developed projection of the costal margin of gill plates III, presence of hair-like setae on the surface of abdominal terga, and relatively wide shape of gill plates VII (in natural position from ventral view). The diagnostic characters are compared to related species, and primary information to habitat is provided.</p>

					<p>ZooKeys 1068: 1-11</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1068.71925</p>
					<p>Authors: Yue Sun, Lei Yu, Xinzheng Li</p>
					<p>Abstract: A new species of the orbiniid genus Phylo Kinberg, 1866, P. heterochaetus sp. nov., is described based on material collected from the northern Yellow Sea, China. This is the thirteenth species in Phylo. The new species can be easily identified by the combination of the following characters: anterior thorax with 13 chaetigers, interramal cirri absent, anterior thoracic neuropodia with 4 or 5 rows of uncini, intermixed with a few subuluncini in the first 1 or 2 rows, and a ventral fringe of numerous stomach papillae present on chaetigers 12–24. Phylo fimbriata is recorded for the first time from China seas.</p>

					<p>ZooKeys 1067: 159-208</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1067.72251</p>
					<p>Authors: Thomas Kaltenbach, Jean-Luc Gattolliat</p>
					<p>Abstract: Material collected between 2006 and 2016 in Borneo, Sulawesi, and New Guinea further increased our knowledge of Labiobaetis Novikova &amp; Kluge in these regions. Five species were previously reported from Borneo, two from Sulawesi, and 33 from New Guinea. Six new species have been identified using a combination of morphology and genetic distance (COI, Kimura 2-parameter), one species from Borneo (Brunei), one from Sulawesi, and four from New Guinea. They are described and illustrated based on their larvae and keys to the species of the relevant groups are provided. Additionally, new reports, a complementary description, and the COI sequence for L. dendrisetis Kaltenbach &amp; Gattolliat are presented. The distribution of Labiobaetis in the Wallacea region is discussed based on the new findings. The total number of Labiobaetis species worldwide is augmented to 153.</p>

					<p>ZooKeys 1067: 83-92</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1067.72596</p>
					<p>Authors: Jinghuai Zhang, Pat Hutchings</p>
					<p>Abstract: The genus Petta Malmgren, 1866 is a small and poorly known genus of the annelid family Pectinariidae Quatrefages, 1866. A previous revision of the genus found that the type material of the species P. assimilis McIntosh, 1885 had been lost. While searching for material from the type locality, we were able to examine material from a similar area but collected in much shallower water from off South Africa which represents another undescribed species of Petta. The new species, Petta brevis sp. nov., is described and compared to P. assimilis McIntosh, 1885, and a revised key to all species in the genus is provided.</p>

					<p>ZooKeys 1067: 57-82</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1067.72779</p>
					<p>Authors: Sedtawut Kwanboon, Michel Sartori, Boonsatien Boonsoong</p>
					<p>Abstract: The aim of this study is to review the family Behningiidae and Potamanthidae in Thailand. Two genera and three species of Behningiidae are recognised: Protobehningia merga Peters &amp; Gillies, 1991, Behningia baei McCafferty &amp; Jacobus, 2006, and Behningia nujiangensis Zhou &amp; Bisset, 2019, which is newly reported from Thailand. The egg structure of B. nujiangensis is described for the first time using scanning electron microscopy. The larva of P. merga is redescribed and its distribution is expended northward with a new record from Chiang Mai province. Two genera and five species of Potamanthidae are identified: Potamanthus formosus Eaton, 1892, Rhoenanthus magnificus Ulmer, 1920 (new record for Thailand), Rhoenanthus obscurus Navás, 1922, Rhoenanthus distafurcus Bae &amp; McCafferty, 1991, and Rhoenanthus speciosus Eaton, 1881. Our morphological evidence is supported by COI data for the family Potamanthidae. Diagnostic characters, distributions, and keys are presented for the larvae of all known species of Thai behningiid and potamanthid mayflies.</p>

		    <title>An overview of Estonian woodlice (Isopoda, Oniscidea)</title>

					<p>ZooKeys 1067: 1-17</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1067.68105</p>
					<p>Authors: Kaarel Sammet, Getriin Orgusaar, Mari Ivask, Olavi Kurina</p>
					<p>Abstract: An overview of the Estonian terrestrial isopod fauna is given, based on literature data and material collected from 1984 to 2021. The identified material consisted of 10915 specimens belonging to 14 species and collected from 172 localities throughout Estonia. In combination with previous data from the literature data, there are now reliable records of 16 species of woodlice from Estonia. Two species, viz. Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii Brandt, 1833 and Hyloniscus riparius (C. Koch, 1838), are new for the fauna. The latter has probably colonised Estonia recently and range expansions have been reported elsewhere. The data on Philoscia muscorum (Scopoli, 1763) are dubious, and this species is currently excluded from the Estonian list.</p>

					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1067.72395</p>
					<p>Authors: Christoph Braun, Ralph S. Peters</p>
					<p>Abstract: Based on 261 female specimens of the genus Dipara Walker, 1833 from leaf litter samples of the Kakamega Forest in Kenya, we describe the following twelve new species: Dipara andreabalzerae sp. nov., Dipara corona sp. nov., Dipara fastigata sp. nov., Dipara kakamegensis sp. nov., Dipara lux sp. nov., Dipara nigroscutellata sp. nov., Dipara nyani sp. nov., Dipara reticulata sp. nov., Dipara rodneymulleni sp. nov., Dipara sapphirus sp. nov., Dipara tenebra sp. nov., and Dipara tigrina sp. nov. For Dipara albomaculata (Hedqvist, 1963) and Dipara nigrita Hedqvist, 1969, we give new distribution records. We examined the available type material of all described Dipara species from the Afrotropical mainland, i.e., Dipara albomaculata (Hedqvist, 1963), Dipara machadoi (Hedqvist, 1971), Dipara maculata (Hedqvist, 1963), Dipara nigrita Hedqvist, 1969, Dipara pallida (Hedqvist, 1969), Dipara punctulata (Hedqvist, 1969), Dipara saetosa (Delucchi, 1962), Dipara straminea (Hedqvist, 1969), Dipara striata (Hedqvist, 1969), and Dipara turneri Hedqvist, 1969. We provide figures, descriptions, and diagnoses of the newly described species and figures and diagnoses of the ten known species as well as an identification key to all species of the Afrotropical mainland.</p>

		    <title>Azooxanthellate Scleractinia (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) from South Africa</title>

					<p>Abstract: Globally, South Africa ranks in the top five countries regarding marine species richness per unit area. Given the high diversity, it is not surprising that many invertebrate taxa in the region are poorly characterised. The South African azooxanthellate Scleractinia (Anthozoa) is one such taxonomic group, and was last reviewed by Boshoff in 1980. Although more recent regional publications have reported on some species, there has not been a faunistic review that accounts for the country’s species diversity since then. Moreover, numerous unidentified specimens representing more than three decades of sampling effort have accumulated. In this study the authors update the state of knowledge of South African azooxanthellate coral species. Specimens, particularly those within the extensive collections of the Iziko South African and Smithsonian museums, were morphologically examined and identified. Other data considered included historic data represented as imagery data, associated species data from recent research surveys, and the scientific literature. To date, the study has increased the total number of known species from 77 to 108 across eleven families, 28 new South African records, and three are new species with one new genus.</p>

					<p>Authors: Muhammad Z. Ahmed, Matthew R. Moore, Eric A. Rohrig, Cindy L. McKenzie, Di Liu, Jinian Feng, Benjamin B. Normark, Douglass R. Miller</p>
					<p>Abstract: This work provides general descriptions, illustrations, molecular diagnostic data, taxonomic keys, slide mounting recommendations, and Florida distribution records for Fiorinia Targioni Tozzetti species occurring in the USA. Species treated are F. externa Ferris, F. fioriniae (Targioni Tozzetti), F. japonica Kuwana, F. pinicola Maskell, F. phantasma Cockerell &amp; Robinson, F. proboscidaria Green, and F. theae Green. New descriptions of second-instar males and females of all seven species in addition to first-instar nymphs and adult females of F. phantasma and F. proboscidaria are presented. Taxonomic keys to second-instar males and females are developed for the first time and previously available taxonomic keys to first-instar nymphs and adult females are improved. DNA sequences were used to further evaluate the monophyly of Fiorinia and provide additional diagnostic tools for Fiorinia species. Multigene phylogenetic analyses, COI barcoding methods, and examination of type material indicate that F. yongxingensis Liu, Cai &amp; Feng, 2020, syn. nov. is a junior synonym of F. phantasma. A morphological survey of the genus demonstrates, for the first time, the utility of second-instar males for diagnostics. This study will help inform regulatory and pest management decisions by facilitating morphological and molecular identification of adventive Fiorinia species occurring in the USA.</p>

		    <title>On the brink of extinction: a new freshwater amphipod Jesogammarus acalceolus (Anisogammaridae) from Japan</title>

					<p>ZooKeys 1065: 81-100</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1065.71687</p>
					<p>Authors: Ko Tomikawa, Naoya Kimura</p>
					<p>Abstract: Freshwater habitats, especially cold springs, are environments in which the risk of extinction faced by organisms remains high due to human activities. To conserve endangered species, it is important to describe and name them. Here, a new, endangered freshwater anisogammarid amphipod species, Jesogammarus (Jesogammarus) acalceolus sp. nov., found in a spring in Aomori Prefecture, Japan, is described which is potentially the sole remaining habitat of this species. Both morphological and molecular phylogenetic results strongly support the nesting of the new species within Jesogammarus. Jesogammarus (J.) acalceolus sp. nov. is the first species of genus Jesogammarus that was found to lack a calceolus, a sensory organ located on male antenna 2. Thus, the diagnostic criteria for this genus required amendment. A reconstruction of ancestral calceoli, based on a molecular phylogenetic tree, revealed that the common ancestor of Jesogammarus possessed calceoli, which were secondarily lost in J. (J.) acalceolus sp. nov. Our results indicate that this new species, which is key to clarifying the evolution of the calceolus, is of high conservation significance.</p>

					<p>Authors: Shurong Xiong, Michael S. Engel, Lifang Xiao, Dong Ren</p>
					<p>Abstract: Two new species of Archidermaptera are described and figured from the Middle Jurassic Jiulonghsan Formation of Daohugou, Inner Mongolia, China. Aneuroderma oiodes gen. &amp; sp. nov. is described in the family Protodiplatyidae and Sinopalaeodermata concavum sp. nov. is established in the family Dermapteridae. Both new species share the typical characters of the extinct suborder Archidermaptera (e.g., pentamerous metatarsi, filiform and multimerous cerci, externalized ovipositor). Aneuroderma gen. nov. is compared with other genera of the Protodiplatyidae, while S. concavum sp. nov. allows us to emend the diagnosis of the genus Sinopalaeodermata. We briefly discuss the diversity of Archidermaptera and challenges to understanding relationships among this mid-Mesozoic diversity.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species of the frog genus Rana sensu lato from Wuyi Mountain, Fujian Province, China is described. Molecular phylogenetic analyses clustered the new species into the R. johnsi group and indicated that it was genetically divergent from its closely related species. The new species could be distinguished from its congeners by a combination of the following characters: body size medium, SVL 41.4–45.6 mm (42.9 ± 1.9 mm, n = 4) in adult males and 47.6–50.3 mm (n = 2) in adult females; adult male with a pair of internal subgular vocal sacs; lateroventral grooves present on tip of toes; webbing on fourth toes reaching the tip of toe; transverse skin ridges distinctly present on the dorsal surface of thigh and tibia, the number large (mean 26.5 ± 2.7, range 22–29, n = 6); breeding males possess creamy white nuptial pad with tiny velvety spines on the dorsal surface of the first finger, divided into three parts.</p>

					<p>Abstract: The primarily Afrotropical genus Euprosthenops Pocock, 1897 is recorded in the Western Palearctic for the first time. A diagnosis and an illustrated description of E. insperatus sp. nov., based on a single male from southern Israel, are provided. Considering the structure of the male palp, the holotype of E. insperatus sp. nov. resembles males of two widespread African species, E. australis Simon, 1898 and E. proximus Lessert, 1916; it differs from them by colouration pattern as well as by the different shapes of the retrolateral tibial apophysis and the palpal sclerites. A short survey of the regional insect and spider genera of the paleotropical origin is also presented.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species of the genus Polypedilum Kieffer, 1912 is described from Baishanzu Nature Reserve, China, based on molecular and morphological data. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on standard barcode sequences confirmed a new clade of Polypedilum (Collartomyia) species. The new species is easily distinguished from its congeners by a combination of the following morphological characters: membrane of wing with a large spot occupying 70% of the proximal area; tergite without dark brown band pigmentation; tarsi I–V dark brown; superior volsella with three outer lateral setae and six long setae along inner base; inferior volsella with setose tubercules. An updated key to adult males of the subgenus Collartomyia is also provided.</p>

		    <title>Annotated catalogue of the Tachinidae (Insecta, Diptera) of Chile</title>
		    <link>https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/62972/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1064: 1-200</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1064.62972</p>
					<p>Authors: James E. O'Hara, D. Monty Wood, Christian R. González</p>
					<p>Abstract: The Tachinidae (Diptera) of Chile are catalogued and information is given on distributions, name-bearing types, synonyms, nomenclatural issues, and pertinent literature. The history of tachinid collectors in Chile and authors who have contributed to the systematic knowledge of Chilean tachinids is extensively reviewed. The classification has been updated and 122 genera and 264 species are recognised in Chile. There is a significant amount of endemism with 28 genera and 100 species known only from Chile. There are also 113 species with distributions shared only between Chile and Argentina, particularly in the southern portions of these countries comprising Patagonia.        The catalogue is based on examination of the original descriptions of all nominal species and all other references known to us containing relevant taxonomic and distributional information, for a total of approximately 450 references. Many of the name-bearing types and other Chilean specimens housed in collections were examined. Taxa are arranged hierarchically and alphabetically under the categories of subfamily, tribe, genus, subgenus (where recognised), and species. Nomenclatural information is provided for genus-group and species-group names, including lists of synonyms (mostly restricted to Neotropical taxa) and name-bearing type data. Species distributions are recorded by country within the New World and by larger geographical divisions in the Old World. Additional information is given in the form of notes and references under valid names at the level of tribe, genus, and species. Two genera are newly recorded from Chile: Chaetoepalpus Vimmer &amp; Soukup, 1940 (Tachinini) (also newly recorded from Argentina) and Patelloa Townsend, 1916 (Goniini). Four species are newly recorded from Chile or other countries: Lypha ornata Aldrich, 1934 (Chile); Chaetoepalpus coquilleti Vimmer &amp; Soukup, 1940 (Argentina and Chile); Phytomyptera evanescens (Cortés, 1967) (Argentina); and Xanthobasis unicolor Aldrich, 1934 (Chile). Eight species previously recorded from Chile are deemed to have been misidentified or misrecorded from Chile (known distributions in parentheses): Archytas incertus (Macquart, 1851) (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay); Archytas seminiger (Wiedemann, 1830) (Brazil, Colombia); Gonia crassicornis (Fabricius, 1794) (Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Middle America, West Indies, Nearctic); Lespesia andina (Bigot, 1888) (Cuba); Lespesia archippivora (Riley, 1871) (widespread Nearctic and most of Neotropical); Neoethilla ignobilis (van der Wulp, 1890) (Mexico, United States); Siphona (Siphona) geniculata (De Geer, 1776) (Palaearctic, Nearctic [introduced]); and Winthemia quadripustulata (Fabricius, 1794) (Palaearctic, Nearctic, Oriental]. As First Reviser we fix Paratheresia rufiventris Townsend, 1929 as the senior homonym and Sarcoprosena rufiventris Townsend, 1929 as the junior homonym when the two are placed together in Billaea Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830; and we fix Mayophorinia angusta Townsend, 1927 as the senior homonym and Metarrhinomyia angusta Townsend, 1927 as the junior homonym when the two are placed together in Myiopharus Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm, 1889. New replacement names are proposed for eight preoccupied names of Neotropical species (country of type locality in parentheses): Billaea rufescens O’Hara &amp; Wood for Sarcoprosena rufiventris Townsend, 1929, preoccupied in the genus Billaea Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 by Paratheresia rufiventris Townsend, 1929 (Peru), nom. nov.; Billaea triquetrus O’Hara &amp; Wood for Sarcoprosena triangulifera Townsend, 1927, preoccupied in the genus Billaea Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 by Dexia triangulifera Zetterstedt, 1844 (Peru), nom. nov.; Eucelatoria nudioculata O’Hara &amp; Wood for Eucelatorioidea nigripalpis Thompson, 1968, preoccupied in the genus Eucelatoria Townsend, 1909 by Chetolyga nigripalpis Bigot, 1889 (Trinidad), nom. nov.; Eucelatoria oblonga O’Hara &amp; Wood for Urodexodes elongatum Cortés &amp; Campos, 1974, preoccupied in the genus Eucelatoria Townsend, 1909 by Exorista elongata van der Wulp, 1890 (Chile), nom. nov.; Lespesia thompsoni O’Hara &amp; Wood for Sturmiopsoidea obscura Thompson, 1966, preoccupied in the genus Lespesia Robineau-Desvoidy, 1863 by Eurigaster obscurus Bigot, 1857 (Cuba), nom. nov.; Myiopharus charapensis O’Hara &amp; Wood for Metarrhinomyia angusta Townsend, 1927, preoccupied in the genus Myiopharus Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm, 1889 by Mayophorinia angusta Townsend, 1927 (Peru), nom. nov.; Myiopharus incognitus O’Hara &amp; Wood for Stenochaeta claripalpis Thompson, 1968, preoccupied in the genus Myiopharus Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm, 1889 by Neoxynopsoidea claripalpis Thompson, 1968 (Trinidad), nom. nov.; and Myiopharus rufopalpus O’Hara &amp; Wood for Paralispe palpalis Townsend, 1929, preoccupied in the genus Myiopharus Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm, 1889 by Myioxynops palpalis Townsend, 1927 (Peru), nom. nov. New type species fixations are made under the provisions of Article 70.3.2 of the ICZN Code for three genus-group names: Parafabricia Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm, 1894 (synonym of Archytas Jaennicke, 1867), type species newly fixed as Parafabricia perplexa Townsend, 1931; Tachinodes Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm, 1889 (synonym of Archytas Jaennicke, 1867), type species newly fixed as Jurinia metallica Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830; and Willistonia Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm, 1889 (synonym of Belvosia Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830), type species newly fixed as Willistonia aldrichi Townsend, 1931.

					<p>Authors: Robert J. Pivar, Bradley J. Sinclair, John K. Moulton</p>
					<p>Abstract: The Niphta Theischinger fauna of South America is revised to include 11 species, nine of which are described as new to science (N. acus Pivar, sp. nov., N. bifurcata Pivar &amp; Moulton, sp. nov., N. bispinosa Pivar &amp; Sinclair, sp. nov., N. brunnea Pivar, sp. nov., N. courtneyi Pivar, sp. nov., N. daniellae Pivar, sp. nov., N. downesi Pivar, sp. nov., N. eurydactyla Pivar, sp. nov., N. mapuche Pivar, sp. nov.). The genus Niphta is redefined, both previously described Chilean species are redescribed, N. halteralis (Edwards) and N. nudipennis (Edwards), and females are described or redescribed where possible. The first descriptions of the immature stages of South American Niphta are provided, which represent a new larval morphotype in Thaumaleidae, as larvae and pupae possess ventral adhesive structures. Furthermore, these larvae were collected from vegetation rather than rocky substrates. Illustrations and micrographs are provided for all species, and scanning electron microscopy images are included for select immatures. A key to species, distribution maps, and discussions regarding phylogenetic affinities and habitat are also included.</p>

					<p>ZooKeys 1063: 23-48</p>

					<p>Abstract: Seasonally dry forests (SDFs) are one of the most challenging ecosystems for amphibians, fueling the diversity of this group of vertebrates. An updated inventory of native amphibians present in the Equatorial SDF is provided, which extends along the Pacific coast of Ecuador and northwestern Peru. The study is based on an extensive field sampling (two thirds of the total records) carried out throughout the Equatorial SDF, along with a compilation of the available information on distribution of amphibians in the region from published scientific papers, museum collections and on-line databases. The final dataset included 2,032 occurrence records for 30 amphibian species, belonging to eight anuran families. Additionally, data regarding conservation status, habitat use, spawn deposition site, reproductive mode, and body size, along with an identification key for all encountered species are provided. The results indicate a strong sampling bias with a deficit in the Peruvian part of the study area, and a need for urgent inventories targeted at under-sampled areas, using modern taxonomic methods. The study emphasizes the conservation priorities in the Equatorial SDF, based on the distribution, conservation status and life-history data. This information should be useful for the local authorities and institutions involved in the management and conservation of biodiversity in SDF.</p>

					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1062.67964</p>
					<p>Authors: Imelda G. Amador-Castro, Francisco J. Fernández-Rivera Melo, Jorge Torre</p>
					<p>Abstract: San Pedro Mártir island is of high biological, ecological, and fishery importance and was declared a biosphere reserve in 2002. This island is the most oceanic in the Gulf of California, and information on its rocky reefs is scarce. The present study aimed to generate the first list of conspicuous invertebrate and fish species based on in situ observations and to examine the community structure of the shallow rocky reefs of the reserve. In addition, we estimated the ecological indicators of richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, and Pielou evenness to evaluate the conservation status of the biosphere reserve. Data were collected annually from 2007 to 2017 through 2,192 underwater SCUBA transects. A total of 35 species of invertebrates and 73 species of fish were recorded. Most of the species are widely distributed along the eastern Pacific. Overall, 64% of the species found in this study are commercially important, and 11 species have been listed as protected. The abundance of commercially important invertebrate species (i.e., the sea cucumber Isostichopus fuscus and the spiny oyster Spondylus limbatus) is decreasing, while commercially important fish species have maintained their abundance with periods of increase. The ecological indicators and the abundance and size of the commercial species indicate that the reserve is in good condition while meeting its conservation objectives.</p>

		    <title>Amphibian fauna of Pakistan with notes on future prospects of research and conservation</title>

					<p>ZooKeys 1062: 157-175</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1062.66913</p>
					<p>Authors: Muhammad Rais, Waseem Ahmed, Anum Sajjad, Ayesha Akram, Muhammad Saeed, Hannan Nasib Hamid, Aamina Abid</p>
					<p>Abstract: Research on amphibians and their conservation have gained worldwide attention, as the group includes the highest number of threatened and Data Deficient species when compared to other vertebrates. However, amphibians have long been neglected in wildlife conservation, management decisions, policy making, and research agendas in Pakistan. In this paper, an annotated checklist of the 21 amphibian species of Pakistan, a key to their identification, and detailed discussions on variation in species, including the genera Minervarya and Sphaerotheca, are provided. We found a statistically significant difference in the morphometric measurements of males but non-significant difference in the females of the two forms (rusty dorsum and dotted dorsum) of S. maskeyi. Some genera, such as Microhyla, Uperodon, Minervarya, Allopaa, Chrysopaa, Euphlyctis, Nanorana, and Sphaerotheca, in Pakistan are in need of additional data for molecular and morphological comparisons with taxa in other South Asian countries. The predicaments of amphibian research in Pakistan are discussed, gaps identified, and suggestions are made. Although the occurrence of chytrid fungus in Pakistan is predicted of low likelihood, a lack of data merits studying the prevalence of the fungus, particularly in the northern regions of the country which exhibit complex and dynamic ecosystems. It is recommended that systematic and coordinated surveys are conducted throughout the country to build a database of species occurrences and distributions. Additionally, the monitoring of wild populations and threat mitigation, as well as appropriate legislation, are suggested as long-term measures. By adopting an inclusive wildlife conservation approach in Pakistan, amphibians could be integrated into wildlife conservation and management efforts.</p>

					<p>Abstract: The present study presents DNA barcoding results for 134 species of Central European Vespoidea, families Mutillidae, Myrmosidae, Sapygidae, Scoliidae, Tiphiidae, Thynnidae, and Vespidae, including DNA barcodes for 100 of the 114 German species. DNA barcoding resulted in unexpected diversity in several families, each with two or more genetic clusters identified by Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). Smicromyrme burgeri Schmid-Egger, sp. nov. and S. langobardensis Schmid-Egger, sp. nov. are described as new from Germany and Italy, respectively. A neotype is designated for Smicromyrme rufipes (Fabricius, 1878). The results of DNA barcoding are discussed in respect to detecting cryptic species and refining species limits.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species of freshwater crab of the genus Nanhaipotamon Bott, 1968 is described from Xiaye Village, Chengxiang Town, Longhai County, Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, China. The new species is distinguished from congeners by the combination of characters of its carapace, third maxilliped, unequal chelipeds, triangular male abdomen and unique male first gonopod. Molecular evidence derived from partial mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI genes also support the species as new.</p>

					<p>Abstract: The minute valvatiform-shelled Hydrobiidae are less studied than other hydrobiid gastropods. In this paper, new data on these snails are presented, which have been collected at twelve springs in southern Greece: one in Boeotia, one on Evvoia Island, and ten on the Peloponnese Peninsula. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear histone (H3) have been used to confirm the determinations and infer the relationships of the studied gastropods. They represent the genera Daphniola, Graecoarganiella and Isimerope. New localities, expanding the known geographic ranges, have been presented for Daphniola hadei and Daphniola louisi. A species of Daphniola found at two localities has been identified as a species new to science, and its description, including the shell, penis, and female reproductive organs is given. Possible relationships between Graecoarganiella and Isimerope are discussed; their representatives are possibly new species. At one locality a single specimen likely represents a new genus: it was found to be most closely related with Islamia, but genetically (p-distance) too distant to be congeneric with Islamia.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species of leaf-mining moth described here as Micrurapteryx baranchikovi Kirichenko, Akulov &amp; Triberti, sp. nov. was detected in large numbers feeding on Thermopsis lanceolata (Fabaceae) in the Republic of Khakassia (Russia) in 2020. A morphological diagnosis of adults, bionomics and DNA barcoding data of the new species are provided. The developmental stages (larva, pupa, adult), male and female genitalia, as well as the leaf mines and the infestation plot in Khakassia are illustrated; the pest status of the new species in the studied region is discussed. Additionally, parasitism rate was estimated, the parasitoid wasps reared from pupae of the new species were identified (morphologically and genetically) and illustrated . Among them, one ichneumonid, Campoplex sp. aff. borealis (Zetterstedt) and two braconids, Agathis fuscipennis (Zetterstedt) and Illidops subversor (Tobias et Kotenko), are novel records for the Republic of Khakassia. Furthermore, they are all documented as parasitoids of Gracillariidae for the first time. The DNA barcode of A. fuscipennis is newly obtained and can be used as a reference sequence for species identification.</p>

					<p>Authors: Jing-Song Shi, Jin-Cheng Liu, Rohit Giri, John Benjamin Owens, Vishal Santra, Sourish Kuttalam, Melvin Selvan, Ke-Ji Guo, Anita Malhotra</p>
					<p>Abstract: We provide a molecular phylogeny of Asian pit vipers (the genus Gloydius) based on four mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, ND4, and cytb). Sequences of Gloydius himalayanus, the only member of the genus that occurs south of the Himalayan range, are included for the first time. In addition, two new species of the genus Gloydius are described based on specimens collected from Zayu, Tibet, west of the Nujiang River and Heishui, Sichuan, east of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The new species, Gloydius lipipengi sp. nov., can be differentiated from its congeners by the combination of the following characters: the third supralabial not reaching the orbit (separated from it by a suborbital scale); wide, black-bordered greyish postorbital stripe extending from the posterior margin of the orbit (not separated by the postoculars, covering most of the anterior temporal scale) to the ventral surface of the neck; irregular black annular crossbands on the mid-body; 23-21-15 dorsal scales; 165 ventral scales, and 46 subcaudal scales. Gloydius swild sp. nov. can be differentiated from its congeners by the narrower postorbital stripe (only half the width of the anterior temporal scale, the lower edge is approximately straight and bordered with white); a pair of arched stripes on the occiput; lateral body lakes black spots; a pair of round spots on the parietal scales; 21 rows of mid-body dorsal scales; zigzag dark brown stripes on the dorsum; 168–170 ventral scales, and 43–46 subcaudal scales. The molecular phylogeny in this study supports the sister relationship between G. lipipengi sp. nov. and G. rubromaculatus, another recently described species from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, more than 500 km away, and indicate the basal position of G. himalayanus within the genus and relatively distant relationship to its congeners.</p>

					<p>Abstract: We report on the first investigation of feather mites associated with birds living on the Barton Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica). We found seven feather mite species of the superfamily Analgoidea from four host species. Two new species are described from two charadriiform hosts: Alloptes (Sternalloptes) antarcticus sp. nov. (Alloptidae) from Stercorarius maccormicki Saunders (Stercorariidae), and Ingrassia chionis sp. nov. (Xolalgidae) from Chionis albus (Gmelin) (Chionidae). Additionally, we provide partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), which was utilized as a DNA barcode, for all seven feather mite species.</p>

		    <title>The complete mitochondrial genome of Microphysogobio elongatus (Teleostei, Cyprinidae) and its phylogenetic implications</title>

					<p>Authors: Renyi Zhang, Qian Tang, Lei Deng</p>
					<p>Abstract: Mitochondria are important organelles with independent genetic material of eukaryotic organisms. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the complete mitogenome of a small cyprinid fish, Microphysogobio elongatus (Yao &amp; Yang, 1977). The mitogenome of M. elongatus is a typical circular molecule of 16,612 bp in length containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a 930 bp control region. The base composition of the M. elongatus mitogenome is 30.8% A, 26.1% T, 16.7% G, and 26.4% C. All PCGs used the standard ATG start codon with the exception of COI. Six PCGs terminate with complete stop codons, whereas seven PCGs (ND2, COII, ATPase 6, COIII, ND3, ND4, and Cyt b) terminate with incomplete (T or TA) stop codons. All tRNA genes exhibited typical cloverleaf secondary structures with the exception of tRNASer(AGY), for which the dihydrouridine arm forms a simple loop. The phylogenetic analysis divided the subfamily Gobioninae in three clades with relatively robust support, and that Microphysogobio is not a monophyletic group. The complete mitogenome of M. elongatus provides a valuable resource for future studies about molecular phylogeny and/or population genetics of Microphysogobio.</p>

		    <title>Extinct before discovered? Epactoides giganteus sp. nov. (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Scarabaeinae), the first native dung beetle to Réunion island</title>

					<p>ZooKeys 1061: 75-86</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1061.70130</p>
					<p>Authors: Michele Rossini, Fernando Z. Vaz-de-Mello, Olivier Montreuil, Nicholas Porch, Sergei Tarasov</p>
					<p>Abstract: We describe a new species of dung beetle, Epactoides giganteus sp. nov., from a single female specimen allegedly collected in the 19th century on Réunion island and recently found at the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle, Paris. This species differs from other species of Epactoides by larger size and a set of other distinctive morphological characters. Epactoides giganteus sp. nov. is the first native dung beetle (Scarabaeinae) of Réunion, and its discovery expands the known area of distribution of the genus Epactoides, which was hitherto believed to be endemic to Madagascar. Like other taxa from Madagascar and peripheral islands (e.g., Comoro, Seychelles, Mascarenes), E. giganteus sp. nov. may have reached Réunion by over-water dispersal. Given the rapid loss of biodiversity on Réunion island and the fact that no additional specimens were re-collected over the last two centuries, it is very likely that E. giganteus sp. nov. has gone extinct. However, we have unconfirmed evidence that the holotype of E. giganteus sp. nov. might be a mislabeled specimen from Madagascar, which would refute the presence of native dung beetles on Réunion. We discuss both hypotheses about the specimen origin and assess the systematic position of E. giganteus sp. nov. by examining most of the described species of Madagascan Epactoides. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the dung beetle fauna of Mascarene Archipelago.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species of fossil cockroach, Fragosublatta pectinata gen. et sp. nov., is described from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The new species is assigned to the family Corydiidae based on the following combination of characters: pronotum with tubercles, tegmina obovate with smallish anal region and spinules on the antero-ventral margin of the front femur (type C1). The new species is the second reported cockroach with ramified antennae. This finding broadens the diversity of Blattodea in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber and provides further evidence of convergent evolution for antennal structures among different insect lineages.</p>

		    <title>A solution to the enigma of the type locality of Telmatobius halli Noble, 1938 (Anura, Telmatobiidae), a frog lost for 86 years</title>
		    <link>https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/67904/</link>

					<p>ZooKeys 1060: 183-192</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1060.67904</p>
					<p>Authors: Claudio Correa</p>
					<p>Abstract: For 80 years, there were no sightings of the Andean frog, Telmatobius halli, due to the ambiguity with which its type locality was described (“warm spring near Ollagüe”, northern Chile). The type specimens were collected during the International High Altitude Expedition to Chile (IHAEC) in 1935 and were subsequently described in 1938. In 2018 and 2020, two studies independently reported the rediscovery of the species, but they reached different conclusions about its identity and geographic distribution. In fact, the populations identified as T. halli in those studies are more phylogenetically related to other species than to each other, so they clearly do not belong to the same taxon. Although the study of 2020 is more in line with the geographic information of the description, it does not consider some bibliographic details and the transport limitations of the IHAEC. Here, based on a detailed analysis of the chronicles of the IHAEC and other bibliographic sources, I first refute the proposals of the 2018 and 2020 studies and then provide a possible solution. The combined information from the chronicles indicates that the type locality of T. halli is found at the sources of the Loa River, a different place from those identified in the two previous studies. By also incorporating geographic information of the time, I conclude that its true type locality is Miño, an abandoned mining camp located near the origin of the Loa River, where currently no populations of the genus have been described.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A new species of the genus Formicoccus Takahashi (Hemiptera, Coccomorpha, Pseudococcidae) collected from the holoparasitic plant Balanophora fungosa J. R. &amp; G. Forst (Balanophoraceae), on Ishigaki Island, Japan, is described as Formicoccus yoshinoi Tanaka, sp. nov. based on the morphology of adult females. This species is similar to F. formicarius (1900) and F. erythrinae Williams, 2004, but differs from them by having fewer than six cerarii, and only one type of ventral oral collar tubular duct distributed on the medial area of the posterior abdominal segments. Keys to the Oriental species of the genus Formicoccus are provided.</p>

					<p>Abstract: A list of amphibian and reptile species that occur in open and forested areas of the Atlantic Forest in the municipality of Cruz das Almas, in the Recôncavo Baiano, eastern Brazil is presented. Field sampling occurred between January 2015 to March 2019, totalling 117 samples distributed in three areas: Parque Florestal Mata de Cazuzinha, Mata da Cascalheira, and Riacho do Machado. A total of 1,848 individuals of 69 species (31 anurans, 14 lizards, 19 snakes, two amphisbaenians, and three testudines) was recorded. Additionally, one individual of Ophiodes striatus was found in Mata da Cascalheira after the end of sampling, totalling 15 lizard species and 70 herpetofaunal species. The prevalence of open-area species and the presence of Phyllopezus lutzae, Diploglossus lessonae, and Dryadosaura nordestina in interior forest patches are discussed. Additionally, a new record of the invasive terrapin Trachemys dorbigni in the State of Bahia is reported.</p>

		    <title>Rare specimen identification in an un-integrated taxonomy: implications of DNA sequences from a Taiwanese Philine (Mollusca, Philinidae)</title>
		    <link>https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/28809/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1060: 93-110</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1060.28809</p>
					<p>Authors: Donald J. Colgan, Shane T. Ahyong, Karine Mardon, Ian M. Brereton</p>
					<p>Abstract: Many species of the gastropod genus Philine have been named from northeastern Asia but scanty descriptions based predominantly on shells make it difficult to determine which are valid. This, plus the sporadic anatomical and genetic information available for many of these species has led to what may be described as an un-integrated taxonomy. In this situation, it is generally preferable to postpone dissection of rare and unusual specimens until relevant diagnostic characters can be established in broader studies. Micro-CT scanning and DNA sequencing were used to examine such a specimen collected recently from deep waters off northeastern Taiwan. Micro-CT examination of the morphology of the internal shell and gizzard plates suggested that, among named species, the sequenced specimen is most similar to P. otukai. It cannot, however, be definitively referred to P. otukai as that species lacks adequate anatomical description or known DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of newly collected DNA sequences show the specimen to be most closely related to, but distinct from the northern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean species, Philine quadripartita. The sequences also confirm genetically that five or more species of Philine occur in northeast Asia, including at least three subject to considerable taxonomic uncertainty.</p>

		    <title>Rossellid glass sponges (Porifera, Hexactinellida) from New Zealand waters, with description of one new genus and six new species</title>

					<p>Authors: Henry M. Reiswig, Martin Dohrmann, Michelle Kelly, Sadie Mills, Peter J. Schupp, Gert Wörheide</p>
					<p>Abstract: New Zealand’s surrounding deep waters have become known as a diversity hotspot for glass sponges (Porifera: Hexactinellida) in recent years, and description and collection efforts are continuing. Here we report on eight rossellids (Hexasterophora: Lyssacinosida: Rossellidae) collected during the 2017 RV Sonne cruise SO254 by ROV Kiel 6000 as part of Project PoribacNewZ of the University of Oldenburg, Germany. The material includes six species new to science, two of which are assigned to a so far undescribed genus; we further re-describe two previously known species. The known extant rossellid diversity from the New Zealand region is thus almost doubled, from nine species in five genera to 17 species in eight genera. The specimens described here are only a small fraction of hexactinellids collected on cruise SO254. Unfortunately, the first author passed away while working on this collection, only being able to complete the nine descriptions reported here. The paper concludes with an obituary to him, the world-leading expert on glass sponge taxonomy who will be greatly missed.</p>

					<p>Authors: Jun Qiu, Cang Ma, Ying-Hui Jia, Jin-Zhao Wang, Shou-Kai Cao, Fang-Fang Li</p>
					<p>Abstract: Plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) are regarded as one of the main causes of the degradation of alpine meadows in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The population density of plateau pikas is directly related to the degree of grassland damage. In this study, field observation was conducted for one week in the southeastern QTP in August 2019. A random encounter model (REM) was used to estimate the population density of plateau pikas from photographs and videos, and the frequencies of different behaviors were calculated. In addition, the effects of water-source distance and terrain on the distribution of plateau pikas and the frequencies of different pika behaviors under different population densities were explored. The observations and knowledge derived from this study provide a reference for the population control of plateau pikas.</p>

					<p>Authors: Lei Wang, Jin-zi Chen, Zi-mei Dong, Guang-wen Chen, Ronald Sluys, De-zeng Liu</p>
					<p>Abstract: Two new species of the genus Dugesia (Platyhelminthes, Tricladida, Dugesiidae) from the tropical monsoon forest in southern China are described on the basis of an integrative taxonomic study involving morphology, karyology, histology, and molecular analyses. The new species Dugesia circumcisa Chen &amp; Dong, sp. nov. is characterised by asymmetrical openings of the oviducts; right vas deferens opening at anterior portion of the seminal vesicle and the left one opening at mid-lateral portion of the seminal vesicle; two diaphragms in ejaculatory duct, the latter being ventrally displaced and opening at the tip of the penis papilla, which is provided with a nozzle; wide duct connecting male atrium and common atrium; chromosome complement triploid with 24 metacentric chromosomes. The other new species, Dugesia verrucula Chen &amp; Dong, sp. nov., is characterised by the large size of the living worm, usually exceeding 3.5 cm in length; asymmetrical openings of the oviducts; subterminal opening of ventrally displaced ejaculatory duct; vasa deferentia symmetrically opening into the postero-lateral portion of the seminal vesicle; well-developed duct between the seminal vesicle and diaphragm; single dorsal bump near the root of the penis papilla; bursal canal with pleated wall and spacious posterior section; unstalked cocoons; chromosome complement diploid with 16 metacentric chromosomes. Inter-specific molecular distances and their positions in the phylogenetic tree reveal that D. circumcisa and D. verrucula are clearly separated from their congeners.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Two new genera and three new species of cave-adapted ground beetles belonging to the tribe Trechini are established and described: Wulongius qilinger gen. nov. and sp. nov. from limestone cave Qiankou Dong (Chongqing: Wulong), Qianotrechus congcongae sp. nov. from cave Shigao Dong (Chongqing: Nanchuan), and Qianlongius zhoui gen. nov. and sp. nov. from cave Qianlong Dong (Guizhou: Songtao). Wulongius qilinger sp. nov. is a small aphaenopsian beetle with a thin and elongated body, while Qianlongius zhoui sp. nov. is a semi-aphaenopsian with a stout body. Both new genera are not closely related to any genus of Trechini occurring in the South China Karst, and so their systematic positions remain unclear.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Nidirana guangxiensis sp. nov., a new music frog species, is proposed, based on a series of specimens collected from Mt Daming, Guangxi, southern China. The new species is close to N. yeae, N. daunchina, N. yaoica, and N. chapaensis from southwestern and south-central China and northern Indochina, while the relationships among these species remain unresolved. Nidirana guangxiensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from all known congeners by the genetic divergences in the mitochondrial 16S and COI genes, the behavior of nest construction, the advertisement call containing 6–11 rapidly repeated regular notes, and a combination of morphological characteristics. Furthermore, the Nidirana populations recorded in Guangxi are clarified in this work, providing valuable new information on the knowledge of the genus Nidirana.</p>

					<p>Authors: Zhe-Yu Chen, Zhi-Tong Lyu, Min Wu</p>
					<p>Abstract: The monotypic genus Stegodera Martens, 1876 is systematically revised based on anatomical and morphological examination of freshly collected specimens. A new species from southern Hunan, which resembles Stegodera angusticollis, is confirmed to represent a new genus evidenced by comparative shell morphology and anatomy as well as by molecular phylogenetic analyses. The new genus might be more closely related to Stegodera and Nesiohelix Kuroda &amp; Emura, but differs anatomically from the latter two genera by the absence of a dart apparatus.</p>

					<p>Authors: Boyan Vagalinski, Sergei I. Golovatch</p>
					<p>Abstract: The diplopod tribe Brachyiulini is represented in the fauna of the Caucasus by eight genera and 32 species, of which one genus and 14 species are described as new: Colchiobrachyiulus montanus Vagalinski, sp. nov., Iraniulus tricornis Vagalinski, sp. nov., Omobrachyiulus armatus Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. fasciatus Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. faxifer Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. kvavadzei Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. lazanyiae Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. ponticus Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. pristis Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. trochiloides Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. unugulis Vagalinski, sp. nov., O. zuevi Vagalinski, sp. nov., Svaniulus ryvkini Vagalinski, gen. nov., sp. nov., and S. waltheri Vagalinski, gen. nov., sp. nov. Colchiobrachyiulus Lohmander, 1936, a former subgenus of Megaphyllum, is here elevated to a full genus, and the genus Grusiniulus Lohmander, 1936 is downgraded to a subgenus of the genus Cyphobrachyiulus Verhoeff, 1900, both stat. nov., with their previously described species, Colchiobrachyiulus dioscoriadis (Lignau, 1915) and Cyphobrachyiulus redikorzevi (Lohmander, 1936), respectively, listed as comb. nov. Omobrachyiulus brachyurus (Attems, 1899) is formally established as a junior subjective synonym of O. caucasicus (Karsch, 1881), syn. nov., and Omobrachyiulus implicitus ritsensis (Golovatch, 1981) is formally synonymised with the typical Omobrachyiulus implicitus (Lohmander, 1936), syn. nov. Omobrachyiulus sevangensis (Lohmander, 1932), originally described in the genus Megaphyllum, is here transferred to the former genus, comb. nov. The diagnoses and descriptions of some genera and subgenera are refined and complemented. A key is given to all genera and species of Brachyiulini that occur in the Caucasus, and their distributions are mapped. Several species are recorded as new to the faunas of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, or Russia. The distribution patterns of the Caucasian Brachyiulini and their biogeographic implications are discussed.</p>

					<p>Abstract: An adult male Synorthocladius was collected in the middle basin of the Adige River in the city of Verona, northern Italy. A combination of atypical characters for the genus signalled a new species. Synorthocladius federicoi sp. nov. is here diagnosed and described. The new species is known only from its type locality and is presumed to be a local biogeographical representative of the Italian Pre-Alps. An emended generic diagnosis, a key to known Synorthocladius from Europe and comments on the taxonomic position of the new species are given.</p>

		    <title>A new species of Leucostethus (Anura, Dendrobatidae) from Gorgona Island, Colombia</title>
		    <link>https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/67621/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1057: 185-208</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1057.67621</p>
					<p>Authors: Taran Grant, Wilmar Bolívar-García</p>
					<p>Abstract: We describe a new species of Leucostethus from Gorgona Island, a small (13 km2) island located 35 km from the Pacific coast of southern Colombia. The new species most resembles L. argyrogaster and L. fugax from western Amazonia at 340–870 m elev. in Peru and Ecuador, with which it shares pale ventral coloration and orange suffusion of the axilla, groin and concealed surfaces of the hind limb, but it is most closely related to L. bilsa from ca. 340 km SW in the southern Chocó at 420–515 m elev., northwestern Ecuador. We report miniscule white spots on the posteroventral surface of the thighs of the new species and, on the basis of our preliminary assessment of their taxonomic distribution, hypothesize that their presence is a synapomorphy of Dendrobatoidea with subsequent losses in a few groups. Given the apparent restriction of the new species to Gorgona Island, it is Vulnerable according to IUCN Red List criteria. In addition to naming the new species, we also propose the following new combinations: L. alacris (Rivero and Granados-Díaz, 1990) comb. nov., L. dysprosium (Rivero and Serna, 2000) comb. nov., and L. yaguara (Rivero and Serna, 1991) comb. nov.</p>

		    <title>A review of the Eviota zebrina complex, with descriptions of four new species (Teleostei, Gobiidae)</title>
		    <link>https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/66675/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1057: 149-184</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1057.66675</p>
					<p>Authors: Luke Tornabene, David W. Greenfield, Mark V. Erdmann</p>
					<p>Abstract: The Eviota zebrina complex includes eight species of closely-related dwarfgobies, four of which are herein described as new. The complex is named for Eviota zebrina Lachner &amp; Karnella, 1978, an Indian Ocean species with the holotype from the Seychelles Islands and also known from the Maldives, which was once thought to range into the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea eastward to the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. Our analysis supports the recognition of four genetically distinct, geographically non-overlapping, species within what was previously called E. zebrina, with E. zebrina being restricted to the Indian Ocean, E. marerubrum sp. nov. described from the Red Sea, E. longirostris sp. nov. described from western New Guinea, and E. pseudozebrina sp. nov. described from Fiji. The caudal fin of all four of these species is crossed by oblique black bars in preservative, but these black bars are absent from the four other species included in the complex. Two of the other species within the complex, E. tetha and E. gunawanae are morphologically similar to each other in having the AITO cephalic-sensory pore positioned far forward and opening anteriorly. Eviota tetha is known from lagoonal environments in Cenderawasih Bay and Raja Ampat, West Papua, and E. gunawanae is known only from deeper reefs (35–60 m) from Fakfak Regency, West Papua. The final two species are E. cometa which is known from Fiji and Tonga and possesses red bars crossing the caudal fin (but lost in preservative) and a 9/8 dorsal/anal-fin formula, and E. oculineata sp. nov., which is described as new from New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and possesses an 8/7 dorsal/anal-fin formula and lacks red caudal bars. Eviota oculineata has been confused with E. cometa in the past.</p>

					<p>Authors: Robin Casalla, Rudolf H. Scheffrahn, Judith Korb</p>
					<p>Abstract: Rugitermes ursulae sp. nov. is described from a sample collected inside a dead branch in a tropical dry forest of Colombia’s Caribbean coast using molecular information and external morphological characters of the imago and soldier castes. Rugitermes ursulae sp. nov. soldiers and imagoes are the smallest among all described Rugitermes species. The imago’s head capsule coloration is dark castaneous, while the pronotum is contrastingly pale yellow. Our description includes soldier characters, such as subflangular elevation and shape of the antennal sockets, that can help in identification of samples lacking imagoes.</p>

					<p>Authors: Hans R. Feijen, Frida A. A. Feijen, Cobi Feijen, Benoît Gilles</p>
					<p>Abstract: For the recently established genus Madagopsina (Diopsidae, stalk-eyed flies), Madagopsina makayensis Feijen, Feijen &amp; Feijen, sp. nov. is described from Madagascar. A concise catalogue is given for the genus and an identification key is presented for its six species. The differential character states are listed for the two species groups of the genus: the Madagopsina apollo species group and the Madagopsina apographica species group. The intrageneric relations are discussed based on morphology, geometric morphometrics analysis of wing shape, and allometric data for eye span against body length. Each of these three procedures places the new species in the M. apollo species group with Madagopsina parvapollina as its closest relative. New records are presented for M. apographica and M. parvapollina.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Two new species of the genus Glyphiulus Gervais, 1847 are described and illustrated. The first species, G. longus sp. nov., is the second species of the javanicus-group to be found in Thailand. It resembles G. guangnanensis Jiang, Guo, Chen &amp; Xie, 2018, from southern China, but is distinguished by a smaller size and the carinotaxic formula of the collum, combined with ♂ legs 1 bearing very strongly reduced telopodites, the anterior gonopods showing a pair of very long and slender apicomesal processes, and the denser plumose and stout flagella of the posterior gonopods. The second species, G. promdami sp. nov., the fifth member of the granulatus-group in Thailand, seems to be particularly similar to G. subbedosae Likhitrakarn, Golovatch &amp; Panha, 2017, from Laos. However, it can be distinguished from the latter species mainly by showing a uniformly yellow collum and the posterior gonopod coxite bearing several strong setae in median and lateral views, coupled with the anterior gonopod coxosternum being microsetose in the anterior and medial parts in caudal view. An identification key to, and a distribution map of, all seven Glyphiulus species currently known to occur in Thailand are also provided.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Two new species of freshwater crab of the genus Potamid Aparapotamon Dai &amp; Chen, 1985 are described from Yunnan Province, southwest China. Morphological comparisons were made between the two new species and type materials of other 11 species of Aparapotamon. Aparapotamon binchuanense sp. nov. and A. huizeense sp. nov. can be separated from their congeners by the shape of the epibranchial tooth, the frontal view of the cephalothorax, the male first gonopod, and the female vulvae. The molecular analyses based on partial mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene are also included. This study brings the number of Aparapotamon species to 13.</p>

		    <title>Composition and natural history of a snake community from the southern Cerrado, southeastern Brazil</title>

					<p>Authors: Bruno F. Fiorillo, Jorge Henry Maciel, Marcio Martins</p>
					<p>Abstract: The natural history of a cerrado snake community in a protected area in southeastern Brazil (Santa Bárbara Ecological Station; SBES) is described. A visual guide and an identification key are also provided to assist researchers and local people in identifying snakes in that region.        Sampling was performed through pitfall traps, time-constrained search, accidental encounters, and observations by local people for two years, which corresponded to 240 days of sampling. Among the 388 individuals found in the field, 33 snake species belonging to 21 genera of seven families were recorded. Most species were restricted or found at least once in non-forest vegetation types (campo sujo, campo cerrado, and cerrado sensu stricto) and a few were restricted to forest habitats (cerradão). Our results show that most species (1) occupy open areas; (2) present both diurnal and nocturnal activity; (3) are primarily terrestrial; (4) include lizards, mammals and/or anurans in the diet; (5) present seasonal reproductive activity; and (6) use mainly visually oriented defensive tactics. Despite its small size (3,154 ha), the SBES harbours preserved habitats and a rich and typical Cerrado snake fauna, including threatened species. Furthermore, most of the SBES snakes occur in non-forest environments (54%) and some species are sensitive to habitat disturbance.</p>

					<p>Abstract: The Mekong River is a hotspot area for freshwater biodiversity, but caddisfly diversity is largely understudied. Three new species of caddisflies from three different families are described and illustrated from Khon Phapheng Waterfall, the Mekong River, Laos; Orthotrichia choengthongi Malicky &amp; Laudee, sp. nov. (Hydroptilidae), Pseudoneureclipsis khonphaphengensis Malicky &amp; Thamsenanupap, sp. nov. (Polycentropodidae), and Setodes karrilai Malicky &amp; Laudee, sp. nov. Orthotrichia choengthongi Malicky &amp; Laudee, sp. nov. can be differentiated from the most similar Orthotrichia triton Malicky 2008 by the specific shape of segment X which is long and tubular, pointed apically and curved inward then immediately upward in dorsal view. Pseudoneureclipsis khonphaphengensis Malicky &amp; Thamsenanupap, sp. nov. differs from the similar P. kaineus Malicky &amp; Bunlue in Malicky et al. 2004 by the shape of the inferior appendages that are usually broad, almost circular in lateral view. Setodes karrilai Malicky &amp; Laudee, sp. nov. is mainly different to S. omphale Malicky &amp; Changthong in Malicky et al. 2004 by the distal part of segment X which has a brush-like process.</p>

		    <title>Dynamic genetic diversity and population structure of Coreius guichenoti</title>

					<p>Authors: Dongqi Liu, Feng Lan, Sicai Xie, Yi Diao, Yi Zheng, Junhui Gong</p>
					<p>Abstract: To investigate the genetic effects on the population of Coreius guichenoti of dam constructions in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, we analyzed the genetic diversity and population structure of 12 populations collected in 2009 and 2019 using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control regions. There was no significant difference in genetic diversity between 2009 and 2019 (P &gt; 0.05), but the population structure tended to become stronger. Genetic differentiation (FST) among five populations (LX, BB, YB, SF and JA) collected in 2009 was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). However, some populations collected in 2019 were significantly differentiated (P &lt; 0.05), indicating that the population structure has undergone change. A correlation analysis showed that the genetic diversity of the seven populations collected in 2019 was significantly negatively correlated with geographical height (r = −0.808, P = 0.028), indicating that the populations at high elevations were more vulnerable than those at low elevations. In order to prevent the further decrease of genetic diversity and population resources, some conservation and restoration suggestions, such as fish passage and artificial breeding, are put forward.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Eight cobweb spider species building a detritus-based, bell-shaped retreat from China are reported in the current paper, including five new Campanicola species and three known species: Campanicola anguilliformis Li &amp; Liu, sp. nov., Campanicola falciformis Li &amp; Liu, sp. nov., Campanicola heteroidea Li &amp; Liu, sp. nov., Campanicola tauricornis Li &amp; Liu, sp. nov., Campanicola volubilis Li &amp; Liu, sp. nov., Campanicola campanulata (Chen, 1993), Campanicola ferrumequina (Bösenberg &amp; Strand, 1906), and Parasteatoda ducta (Zhu, 1998). Among them, the male of Parasteatoda ducta (Zhu, 1998) is described for the first time. We provide photographs of all species and descriptions for new species in the current paper. The type of bell-shaped retreat is rare in theridiid, and found only in four related genera. A natural next step upon completing this taxonomic study would be to analyse and understand the evolution of the retreat and related traits.</p>

		    <title>Resolving a century-old case of generic mistaken identity: polyphyly of Chitoniscus sensu lato resolved with the description of the endemic New Caledonia Trolicaphyllium gen. nov. (Phasmatodea, Phylliidae)</title>

					<p>Authors: Royce T. Cumming, Stephane Le Tirant, Thies H. Büscher</p>
					<p>Abstract: With every molecular review involving Chitoniscus Stål, 1875 sensu lato samples from Fiji and New Caledonia revealing polyphyly, the morphology from these two distinct clades was extensively reviewed. Morphological results agree with all previously published molecular studies and therefore Trolicaphyllium gen. nov. is erected to accommodate the former Chitoniscus sensu lato species restricted to New Caledonia, leaving the type species Chitoniscus lobiventris (Blanchard, 1853) and all other Fijian species within Chitoniscus sensu stricto. Erection of this new genus for the New Caledonian species warrants the following new combinations: Trolicaphyllium brachysoma (Sharp, 1898), comb. nov., Trolicaphyllium erosus (Redtenbachher, 1906), comb. nov., and Trolicaphyllium sarrameaense (Größer, 2008a), comb. nov. Morphological details of the female, male, freshly hatched nymph, and egg are illustrated and discussed alongside the Chitoniscus sensu stricto in order to differentiate these two clades which have been mistaken as one for decades.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Mohnia kurilana Dall, 1913 was described more than 100 years ago from deep waters off the Kuril Islands and remains exceedingly rare in museum collections. Originally placed in the carnivorous neogastropod family Buccinidae, fragmentary soft parts from the type lot and from several specimens belonging to allied species collected in the Aleutian Islands in the 1990s have allowed anatomical investigations for the first time. These have revealed the presence of a paucispiral operculum with an eccentric nucleus, foot with a deep propodial pedal gland and metapodial pedal gland, taenioglossate radula, short acrembolic proboscis, well-developed mid-esophageal gland, glandular prostate, and the absence of a penis; the nervous system is epiathroid with a long supra-esophageal connective and numerous statoconia in the statocysts. Analysis of the gut contents revealed abundant halichondriid sponge spicules. This evidence indicates a placement in the Triphoroidea, a diverse superfamily of specialized spongivores. Mohnia kurilana is transferred to the Newtoniellidae and placed in the new genus Pseudomohnia gen. nov. Pseudomohnia rogerclarki sp. nov. is established for a new species from the Aleutian Islands characterized by its narrowly turreted shell and distinctive multicuspid rachidian. A lectotype is designated for Mohnia kurilana.</p>

					<p>Abstract: Thirty-seven holothuroid species, including six potentially new, are reported from the eastern Weddell Sea in Antarctica. Information regarding sea cucumbers in this dataset is based on Agassiz Trawl (AGT) samples collected during the British Antarctic Survey cruise JR275 on the RRS James Clark Ross in the austral summer of 2012. Species presence by site and an appendix of holothuroid identifications with registrations are included as supplementary material. Species occurrence in the Weddell Sea is updated to include new holothuroids from this expedition.</p>

		    <title>Exploring the use of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) in the taxonomy of sea cucumbers: a case-study on the gravel sea cucumber Neopentadactyla mixta (Östergren, 1898) (Echinodermata, Holothuroidea, Phyllophoridae)</title>

					<p>Abstract: Sea cucumber taxonomy and systematics has in the past heavily relied on gross external and internal anatomy, ossicle assemblage in different tissues, and molecular characterisation, with coloration, habitat, and geographical and bathymethric distribution also considered important parameters. In the present paper, we made these observations and techniques in detail and complemented them with the novel technique of micro-computed tomography of the calcareous ring. We investigated a single European species, the so-called gravel sea cucumber, Neopentadactyla mixta (Östergren, 1898), using recently collected material from the Chausey Islands, Normandy, France. We redescribed the species, illustrated its ossicle assemblage through scanning electron microscopy, and visualised the calcareous ring through stacking photography and through micro-CT scanning. Additionally, a DNA fragment of 955 base pairs of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was sequenced from one specimen, which showed a high similarity with the only sequence of N. mixta publicly available. We completed this integrative study by providing a detailed distribution of the occurrence of N. mixta based on published, verifiable accounts.</p>

		    <title>Selva Zoque, Mexico: an important Mesoamerican tropical region for reptile species diversity and conservation</title>
		    <link>https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/67916/</link>
		    <description><![CDATA[
					<p>ZooKeys 1054: 127-153</p>
					<p>DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1054.67916</p>
					<p>Authors: José Luis Aguilar-López, Ricardo Luría-Manzano, Eduardo Pineda, Luis Canseco-Márquez</p>
					<p>Abstract: The Selva Zoque region is characterized by a great variety of ecosystems for which there is little information about reptile species diversity and their conservation status. This study is the first assessment of the species richness, composition, and conservation status of reptiles of this region. Additionally, this information is compared with that of seven other tropical regions in northern Mesoamerica. In total, 141 native reptile species belonging to 81 genera and 29 families are recorded for the Selva Zoque region. Sixty species (42% of the total) recorded in Selva Zoque are in high-risk categories according to the Mexican Ministry of the Environment, the highest number for the Mexican regions of Mesoamerica. According to the IUCN, six species are in high-risk categories, seven species are in Data Deficient, and 23 (16%) have not been evaluated yet. According to the Environmental Vulnerability Scores approach, 28 species (20%) are in the high vulnerability category. The Selva Zoque species composition is most similar to Los Tuxtlas and Lacandona regions, and most dissimilar to Sian Ka´an Biosphere Reserve. The reptilian fauna of Selva Zoque has a distinctive composition, with the highest number (11 species) of endemic reptiles in the northern Mesoamerican, and species from two biogeographic provinces: the Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Pacific Coast. These results indicate that the Selva Zoque is the most diverse region in native reptile species in northern Mesoamerica, highlighting it as extremely important for the conservation of the reptile fauna at local (southern Mexico) and regional levels (northern Mesoamerica).</p>
